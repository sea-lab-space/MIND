          "patient": "A bit fed up. At 4 in the morning, everything just seems very black. It's just like swimming and tree cooling in. And I just don't... I think by tea time, by the time the kids get home, I've been able to have a fairly decent conversation with them."

The supermarket's been taken over and they've cut the wages, and problems with the bills, it's like catalogues again, just write me letters. You know, the kids, they want all these new games and stuff. It's just, you know."

        {
          "clinician": "Okay. What about eating? What's your appetite been like while you've been feeling like this?",
          "patient": "I used to have quite a weight problem, but the last couple of months that's just a bit looser, just... know how. No, no, the kids come in from school and they make their own stuff, you know, just don't bother, really."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so your appetite's gone down as well. What about things like concentrating and your memory, both when, I don't know, watching TV at home or out when you're out doing your job?",
          "patient": "Well, it... might be pretty useless with the kids. So I forgot the swimming money last week, PE kit and parents' evening, even, start one job and... like I'm not explaining myself very well, it's like the television, I used to like watching the soaps, EastEnders or something, and 10 minutes later just... you know, I'm thinking of something else."

          "clinician": "Okay. And what about things, Alison, that you used to enjoy? Are there things in life that you still enjoy at the moment?",
          "patient": "Nothing really. As I say, a bit useless with the kids, used to enjoy going out. I used to go out with my friends for pictures and things. But of course, now... just can't be bothered. You don't feel like it as well. What's the point, really? You know?"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And I was going to ask, how old are your children now?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "And looking after children takes a lot of time and energy. How are you managing to keep up with that, feeling as low as you do?",
          "patient": "Well, they're a bit self-sufficient, really. The kids do, they're from school, get their own tea, I should be doing more for them really, but now I'm just a bit useless at that at the moment."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And what about looking after yourself?",
          "patient": "Well, you can see I'm just a mess. Dave used to say, that's my boyfriend, I used to, you know, not have much money, but I'd take a bit of pride in what I was doing, you know, and my hair and stuff. Back home, can't be bothered with that. Now's no point, really."

          "clinician": "And how are things, because often when people feel really down, it has a real impact on everything, including their relationships. How are things between you and Dave at the moment?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "It's a slightly embarrassing thing to ask about, but I guess it's important. Often when people are really feeling very low, it affects everything in their relationship, including things like the sex life. Have you noticed any changes there for you?",
          "patient": "He's always trying to pressure me a little bit. I'm really not into that at the moment."

        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. So can I just recap, Alison, and check I've got this right? For the last few months, you've been feeling really down, no energy, problems with your sleeping and eating, problems with concentrating, not really enjoying things and actually struggling a bit with the kids and perhaps some difficulties in your relationship with Dave. Have I got that right?",
          "patient": "Yeah"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Can I ask, Alison, in the past, have there ever been episodes when you felt like this?",
          "patient": "When my husband left. I was always crying then, for no particular reason. I haven't told anybody this before, but I took some tablets."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So how long ago were we talking about this? A few years ago?",
          "patient": "About four years. About four years ago."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so you took some tablets. Can you tell me, is it all right? Tell me a little bit more about that.",
          "patient": "What it's like? Kids are in bed. And you're on your own. And had a few glasses of wine, and just took these tablets."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. Do you remember what you actually took at the time, what sort of tablets they were?",
          "patient": "They just did the bathroom cabinet and... paracetamol"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so you took some paracetamol. Can you remember sort of roughly how many you took?",
          "patient": "About almost two strips, about 12."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Right, okay. And you'd had a couple of glasses of wine. Did you take anything else, any other tablets with it? And was this something, Alison, that you'd thought about for a while, or was it something that was quite a sort of spur of the moment decision that evening?",
          "patient": "There are so many crying a lot, but I just... but you know, it's a... of a burden to everybody really."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And was there any other things you did around the time? Sometimes when people take time, because they leave a note or do other kind of final acts, get their affairs in order, did you do any of those things?",
          "patient": "Just took the tablets and go to sleep."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay? So did you have any thoughts about what taking the tablets would do? Did you...?",
          "patient": "I just thought I'd go to sleep and not wake up. But I woke up a couple of hours later and I was really sick everywhere. God."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So, so you actually, if I wanted to check, I get this right? Because at this point, you actually thought they would kill you? At the time.",
          "patient": "I just did one call. I just say I'm just a useless, just a useless mom now. And I was there."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. So you took the tablets, you were very sick in the night. Did you seek any medical help at the time?",
          "patient": "No, no."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. And then you were okay the following day?",
          "patient": "Yeah, just felt a bit of a twit, really."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Did you feel pleased that you were still alive?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "So that was a few years ago. So if we just come back to how you're feeling at the moment, you've talked about feeling very low. Have there been times currently when you've thought about either taking an overdose or doing something else to harm yourself in any way?",
          "patient": "You know what, no. When you're watching the clock and you know you're on your own, the kids are in bed, it just... everything's so hard. And yeah, but you know, it just feels easy, you know?"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And has that just been something you've thought about? Have you actually made any plans, got any tablets in or done anything else?",
          "patient": "No."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And I guess it's a difficult question to ask, but one we would ask everybody in your situation. Have things ever been so bad, you've got so low that you've not only thought about harming yourself or perhaps killing yourself, but also wondered whether the best thing might be to take the children with you?",
          "patient": "My kids, they look like kids. no."
        },

          "clinician": "Okay. And what about sort of the other side of that, things, positive things, sort of things to look for, things that you feel good about?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "And are there other things that help then? I'm thinking about people who can be supportive.",
          "patient": "My sister, as I say, she said to get down here and she's always there. She comes down, rings, got a couple of friends, they're quite good, but on day one is in the mood, of course, but I don't think he's going to be around for much longer."

          "clinician": "Do you think or do you feel able to keep yourself safe at the moment from hurting yourself?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "Do you think if that was to change so that you didn't feel you're able to keep yourself safe, you'd be able to let anybody know?",
          "patient": "All I know what happened last time, that was nothing. No, no, no, no, was silly then. So now I'd come here."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so, well, thanks for going through all that. I can appreciate it must be very painful. It does sound to me like you are suffering from symptoms that strongly suggest that you're actually depressed at the moment. Now, I'm not sure how much you know about depression.",
          "patient": "Not much really"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Well, I guess just briefly, depression can cause a number of problems for people. Traditionally, we think about people feeling very low and very miserable and often thinking about hurting themselves, but it can also affect all other areas of life in terms of problems of eating and sleeping. And the other problems you've noticed is that concentration and perhaps not really managing as well as normal. I guess the positive side is that you've done something about it and you've come to talk to me about it today. And I think there are almost certainly a range of things we can put in place to help you and treatments that are available. So I guess what I'm thinking was it might be worth just spending a few minutes just thinking about some of those options for you so that we can start to improve things for you. Would that be all right with you?",

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nAlison, a woman in her late 30s to early 40s, presents today at the urging of her sister due to feeling \"fuddled up\" and low for the past few months. She describes persistent low mood, particularly severe in the early morning hours, with feelings of misery and tearfulness triggered by minor events. Alison reports significant anhedonia, stating she no longer enjoys activities she previously liked, such as spending time with her children or going out with friends. She feels exhausted, spends most days on the sofa, and has been missing work at the supermarket due to low energy and motivation. She reports financial stressors and relationship difficulties with her partner, Dave, who has become more distant. Alison describes poor sleep initiation (taking hours to fall asleep), frequent early morning awakening (around 4 am), and inability to return to sleep, resulting in persistent fatigue. Appetite has decreased, and she has lost weight. She reports poor concentration and memory, forgetting tasks related to her children and work, and difficulty following television programs. Alison feels she is not caring for herself or her children as she would like, expressing guilt and worthlessness. She denies current suicidal ideation or plans but has a history of a paracetamol overdose four years ago during a previous depressive episode, which she describes as impulsive and not premeditated. She has supportive relationships with her sister and some friends, and states she feels able to keep herself safe at present.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Appearance: Disheveled, low affect, poor self-care as per self-report.\n- Speech: Slow, monotone, coherent.\n- Mood: Subjectively low, congruent affect.\n- Thought process: Logical, though preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness and guilt.\n- No evidence of psychosis or current suicidal intent.\n- Insight: Good; recognizes symptoms and is seeking help.\n- Social: Two children (ages 9 and 11), lives with them, has a partner (relationship strained), supportive sister.\n- Function: Marked impairment in occupational, social, and parental roles.\n- No reported substance misuse (apart from occasional alcohol in the past).\n- No acute medical issues reported.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAlison is experiencing a moderate to severe depressive episode, characterized by persistent low mood, anhedonia, sleep and appetite disturbance, low energy, poor concentration, feelings of worthlessness, and significant functional impairment. There is a past history of a suicide attempt (paracetamol overdose) during a previous episode of depression, but no current suicidal ideation or intent. She has some protective factors, including her children, sister, and willingness to seek help. There are significant psychosocial stressors, including financial difficulties and relationship strain. No evidence of psychosis or mania.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Pharmacological:** Initiate Sertraline 50 mg once daily in the morning. Discussed potential side effects (e.g., GI upset, sleep disturbance, increased anxiety initially) and the need for several weeks before full effect.\n2. **Psychosocial:** Encouraged Alison to maintain contact with her sister and supportive friends. Advised on the importance of routine and self-care, even in small steps.\n3. **Safety:** Alison denies current suicidal ideation or intent and has a safety plan in place (will contact clinic or sister if thoughts worsen). Provided crisis contact information.\n4. **Follow-up:** Review in 2 weeks to assess response to medication, side effects, and risk. Sooner review if symptoms worsen or suicidal thoughts emerge.\n5. **Further support:** Discussed referral to counseling or psychological therapies (e.g., CBT) and provided information on local services.\n6. **Work:** Advised to consider discussing her situation with her employer and to seek support if needed.\n7. **Education:** Provided psychoeducation about depression, its symptoms, and the expected course of treatment.\n\nAlison was receptive to the plan and agreed to start medication and attend follow-up. She understands the importance of seeking help if her safety becomes a concern.",

        {
          "clinician": "That sounds really tough. Have you noticed if anything makes your sleep a bit better or worse?",
          "patient": "If I try to walk more or when I’m really exhausted from work, I might nod off quicker. But sometimes even then, I wake up and can’t go back."

          "clinician": "How about your appetite these days, Alison? Last time you said you weren’t eating much—has that improved at all?",
          "patient": "Not really. Most days I just skip lunch. Sometimes the kids make their own dinner and I just pick at what’s left, if anything."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Have you noticed any changes in your weight, or have people commented?",
          "patient": "My clothes feel a bit looser. My sister noticed I’ve lost a bit. But I don’t really check anymore."

        {
          "clinician": "You were continuing your Sertraline medication, is that right? Are you still taking it regularly?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I take it in the morning like supposed to. Haven’t missed a dose."
        },

        },
        {
          "clinician": "We also spoke before about how things have been feeling at home, especially with the kids. How has that been lately?",
          "patient": "It’s hard, honestly. They still pretty much look after themselves after school. I feel guilty... I know I should be doing more for them, but I just can’t."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re dealing with depression and exhaustion. Have the kids said anything about it to you?",
          "patient": "Not really. My daughter helps her brother, makes sandwiches for them both. Sometimes she asks why I’m so tired. I just say work is hard."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And your relationship with Dave—how are things going there since we last spoke?",
          "patient": "Still a bit distant, I guess. We don’t really go out anymore. He calls less. Sometimes he seems frustrated. I know it’s because I’m not up for things, just not myself."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Have the two of you talked about how you’re feeling, or how it’s affecting the relationship?",
          "patient": "Not properly. He tries, but I just shut down a lot. He says I need to let him in, but I don’t know how."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It can be really difficult to open up when you’re feeling low. Would you feel comfortable if we talked about ways you might be able to share a little more with him?",
          "patient": "Maybe. It’s just, I feel like he doesn’t get it, and I don’t want to be a burden to him."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Those feelings are very common. Many people feel like they’re burdening loved ones, but often loved ones do want to help. Would you be open to exploring this further together—maybe what you might say, or how to start that conversation?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I think so. I just don’t know where to start, really."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s okay. We can talk about some simple ways to begin. Even just sharing that you’re struggling and that it’s hard to talk about can be a first step. Would you be willing to try saying that to Dave?",
          "patient": "I could try. I’m scared he’ll just get more frustrated though."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It's possible, but it could also help him understand what you’re going through. Maybe you could write down how you’re feeling before you say it, just to get your thoughts straight. Would that help?",
          "patient": "Maybe. I used to write in a diary sometimes. Haven’t done that in ages."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a great idea—maybe picking that up again could be helpful, just for you too. It could help get some thoughts out of your head. Would you like to try starting that again over the next week?",
          "patient": "I could. I’ll try."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "You mentioned your sister’s been supportive—has that continued? Are you able to see or talk with her often?",
          "patient": "Yeah, she drops by some days after work, or calls. She’s good to me, nags a bit, but she means well."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Having supportive people like her is so important. How do you feel after talking to her or seeing her?",
          "patient": "Usually a little better. Sometimes she makes me laugh. Sometimes I just feel guilty for being a mess."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It’s okay to feel that way, Alison, but remember you’re doing your best right now. Have you been able to see or talk with any other friends lately?",
          "patient": "Not really. I just don’t reach out. I feel like I’ve let most people drift away. Don’t want them to see me like this."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "I understand. Social connection can help, even if it’s just a short message. Would you feel comfortable sending a text or message to a friend this week, just to say hello?",
          "patient": "I can try. Might just text my old work mate, see how she’s doing."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That sounds like a good plan. Sometimes a small step can make a difference. How about work—how have things been there?",
          "patient": "It’s been... unstable. They keep changing shifts, cutting hours. I’ve been missing days. Whole thing makes me anxious, but I need the job for the money."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That sounds incredibly stressful. Do you feel supported by anyone at work, or is there someone you can talk to about your schedule or workload?",
          "patient": "Not really. The new manager just cares about numbers. The other ladies I work with try, but everyone’s just worried about keeping their jobs."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It’s a difficult situation. Are you able to take breaks when you need them at work?",
          "patient": "Sort of. Sometimes I just go to the bathroom for a few minutes to breathe. But I don’t like leaving the floor—feels like someone will get mad."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "You’re doing what you can. Let’s think together about managing the stress. Are there things, even very small, that help you calm down during your day?",
          "patient": "If I can step outside for a minute, get some air, it helps. Or just take a deep breath in the back room."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s good—you’ve found some coping skills already. Are you finding time at all to go outside or into any green spaces for yourself, even just a few minutes?",
          "patient": "No, not really. I usually just go from the flat to the bus or work and back. Don’t really go to parks or anything. Too tired."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Even a few minutes outside can sometimes help lift your mood a little. Would you be willing to try stepping outside for a short walk, maybe just down your street, once this week?",
          "patient": "I guess. If it’s not raining, maybe after I drop the kids at school."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a good plan. Even five or ten minutes can sometimes help. We saw last time you’d increased your steps a bit—do you feel any difference when you’re a little more active?",
          "patient": "Maybe. I don’t notice much, but I guess I feel less anxious if I move instead of sit all day."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a really positive thing to notice. It doesn’t have to be a lot—just a little extra movement can sometimes help boost your mood or manage anxiety. Would you like to come up with a small activity goal together for the week?",
          "patient": "I could try. Maybe just walk around the block once more each day."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s excellent. We’ll aim for that—no pressure if some days it doesn’t happen. Now, I wanted to check about thoughts of self-harm or feeling hopeless. Have you had any thoughts like that recently?",
          "patient": "No, not really. I get overwhelmed, but I haven’t wanted to hurt myself. Sometimes just wish things were easier or I could run away for a bit."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Those feelings are understandable when life is this hard. Remember you can always reach out here if you’re struggling. Do you feel able to keep yourself safe between now and our next session?",
          "patient": "Yes. I promised my sister and the kids. I know I can come in if things get bad."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s really good to hear, Alison. Are there things you do that make you feel even a little bit more hopeful, even briefly?",
          "patient": "Sometimes my kids say something funny, or draw a picture. That helps for a few minutes. Or if my sister makes me a cup of tea and we laugh about something silly on TV."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Those are really special moments, even if they’re small. Would you be willing to try and write down one of those moments each day, as a way to remind yourself there are good things even during a tough time?",
          "patient": "I guess I could try. Even little things?"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Even the smallest things—even just noticing the kids laughing or something that made you smile.",
          "patient": "Okay. I’ll try to do that."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Alison, I also notice your screen time has gone up. Are you finding that using your phone is helping, or is it making things harder for you?",
          "patient": "Mostly just scrolling. It’s a distraction, but sometimes makes me feel worse—everyone seems so happy on there."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That can be tough. Maybe you can try limiting it, just for parts of the day, and replace a few minutes of scrolling with something else—like writing in your diary, or sending a message to a friend. How does that sound?",
          "patient": "Makes sense. I’ll try to put the phone down at night especially. Maybe that’ll help me sleep, too."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Definitely worth a try. Before we finish today, can we make a plan together for this week? Something like: 1) walk outside once, 2) write down one good thing each day, 3) message a friend, and 4) try writing in your diary. How does that feel?",
          "patient": "That sounds good, actually. Feels doable. I’ll try my best."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s all I ask, Alison—just try your best. We’ll check in on how it went next time, and see what helped. Is there anything else you want to talk about or ask before we end today?",
          "patient": "No, I think that’s it. Thanks for listening. It helps just saying it out loud."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "You’re always welcome to share here, Alison. Remember, you’re not alone in this. I’ll see you next week—don’t hesitate to contact us sooner if you need support before then.",

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nAlison returns for follow-up, reporting ongoing fatigue and low mood. She describes persistent sleep difficulties, with nights of minimal rest and frequent awakenings, despite attempts to increase physical activity. She continues to experience poor appetite, often skipping meals, and has noticed some unintentional weight loss (clothes fitting looser, family members commenting). Alison expresses feelings of guilt regarding her limited engagement with her children, who have become more self-sufficient. She reports a distant relationship with her partner, Dave, and finds it difficult to communicate her feelings, fearing she may be a burden. Alison acknowledges some support from her sister, which provides brief moments of relief, but overall she feels isolated and has withdrawn from friends. Work remains a significant stressor due to unstable hours and lack of support, contributing to her anxiety. She denies any current thoughts of self-harm or suicidality, stating she has made promises to her family and feels able to keep herself safe. Alison identifies small positive moments with her children and sister but finds it hard to sustain hope. She notes increased screen time, which serves as a distraction but sometimes worsens her mood. She is open to trying strategies such as journaling, reaching out to friends, and increasing outdoor activity.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Appearance: Tired, low energy, affect congruent with mood.\n- Speech: Normal rate and tone, coherent.\n- Thought process: Logical, no evidence of psychosis.\n- Mood: Depressed, anhedonic.\n- Sleep: Ongoing insomnia, variable sleep duration, frequent awakenings.\n- Appetite: Poor, decreased intake, unintentional weight loss.\n- Medication adherence: Taking Sertraline daily as prescribed, no missed doses, no reported side effects.\n- Social: Limited support network (sister supportive, children self-sufficient), minimal contact with friends, strained relationship with partner.\n- Safety: Denies suicidal ideation or self-harm; safety plan in place.\n- Function: Struggling with work attendance and performance due to anxiety and fatigue; minimal engagement in pleasurable activities.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAlison continues to experience symptoms of moderate to severe major depressive disorder, with persistent low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, poor appetite, and social withdrawal. She is adherent to Sertraline with no side effects but has not noted significant improvement in core symptoms. Psychosocial stressors remain prominent, including work instability, limited social support, and strained family relationships. Protective factors include her commitment to her children and sister, willingness to engage in therapy, and openness to behavioral interventions. No acute safety concerns at present.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Medication:** Continue Sertraline as previously prescribed. Monitor for efficacy and side effects. Consider dose adjustment or augmentation if no improvement at next review.\n2. **Therapeutic Interventions:**  \n   - Encourage daily journaling to process emotions and track positive moments.\n   - Support Alison in initiating brief, honest conversations with her partner about her struggles, possibly starting with written communication.\n   - Reinforce the value of small, achievable goals: walking outside at least once this week, messaging a friend, and writing down one positive moment each day.\n   - Discuss strategies to limit screen time, especially before bed, to improve sleep hygiene.\n3. **Social Support:**  \n   - Encourage continued contact with her sister and gradual reconnection with friends (e.g., sending a text).\n   - Explore additional community or peer support resources if isolation persists.\n4. **Work/Function:**  \n   - Validate work-related stress; discuss coping strategies for managing anxiety at work (e.g., brief breaks, breathing exercises).\n   - Monitor impact of work instability on mood and functioning.\n5. **Safety:**  \n   - Reassess risk at each visit; Alison is aware of how to access crisis support if needed.\n   - Maintain open communication regarding any changes in mood or safety.\n6. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Review progress on behavioral goals and symptom changes at next appointment (scheduled in one week).\n   - Consider referral for additional psychological support (CBT or counseling) if symptoms persist or worsen.\n\nAlison is receptive to the plan and agrees to try the outlined strategies. She will contact the clinic if her mood deteriorates or if she experiences any safety concerns before the next scheduled visit.",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a real achievement, especially given how hard things have felt. How was getting out for a walk?",
          "patient": "It was okay. First time I just kind of wanted to get back home, but the second time I went past the corner shop and saw an old neighbor. We just nodded and that was it—but it felt sort of normal for a minute."

        {
          "clinician": "Those little moments of connection can be meaningful. How did you feel after each walk?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s good feedback. Sometimes the benefit is subtle, just getting a little distance from the cycle of thoughts at home. What about messaging a friend or writing in your diary—were you able to try those?",

          "patient": "A bit lighter, I think. Less crowded in my head. Messaging… made me a bit anxious, like maybe she could tell I’m not really okay. But it was good to just talk about something else, even just about her cat."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It’s totally normal to feel anxious about reaching out, but that connection, as small as it is, really matters. How was your sleep and appetite this week? Any changes at all?",
          "patient": "Sleep is about the same. Some nights I’m scrolling on my phone too long, even though I tried to cut it back. I think I slept through two nights but then the next it was all over the place again."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s understandable—habits don’t change overnight. Did putting the phone down earlier make any difference when you tried?",
          "patient": "A bit. One night I put it away and read an old magazine. Still took ages to fall asleep but my mind wandered less. Maybe I’ll try it again."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Sounds promising. Sometimes these little habits build up to bigger changes. What about eating—are you still struggling with your appetite?",
          "patient": "Yeah, pretty much. Still skipping meals, just don’t feel hungry. The kids cooked scrambled eggs last night and I had a few bites, but mostly still just picking at things."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that. Low appetite is common with depression. How have your energy levels been—any improvement, or still quite low?",
          "patient": "Still really tired. Sometimes I have bursts—I’ll clean the kitchen or fold some laundry—but it goes almost as soon as it comes."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It’s exhausting carrying all this. I noticed in your data that screen time goes up when stress and low mood increase. Have you noticed that using your phone more makes you feel better or worse overall?",
          "patient": "Honestly, it’s a habit. I scroll through photos, through social media, even when it makes me feel worse. Feels like something to do when the house is quiet."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "You’re not alone—many people do that. But being aware of it is the first step. When you’ve put the phone away, have you found anything else helpful to wind down in the evenings?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a good plan, Alison. Let’s move on to your relationships a bit. Have you had any more conversations with Dave about how you’re feeling, or any changes in that area?",
          "patient": "Not really. I thought about what we talked about last time, but I sort of chickened out. He’s been quiet too. Sent a few texts but doesn’t come by much lately."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That sounds really difficult. Does his distance make you feel more alone, or is it a relief in some way?",

        },

        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s understandable. Even telling him it’s hard to talk because you care and don’t want to be a burden might help him understand better. Want to try saying just that much here first?",

        },

          "clinician": "That connection is really valuable, even when you don’t talk about anything deep. How does it make you feel after spending time with her?",

          "patient": "The supermarket is still chaos. More people had their hours cut. I ended up missing a shift because I just couldn’t get out of bed. I called in sick, but now I feel guilty."

          "clinician": "That situation sounds very stressful. Did anyone at work check in or ask how you’re doing?",

          "clinician": "You’re still giving your kids love, even if it doesn’t feel like enough. Children often sense more than we know, and the fact that your daughter made something for you shows she cares deeply. Did their gestures lift your mood, even for a moment?",

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nAlison returns for follow-up, reporting that her mood has remained largely unchanged since the last session, with days often blending together. She describes ongoing low energy, persistent fatigue, and continued difficulty with motivation. Alison has made efforts to implement some behavioral strategies discussed previously: she wrote down one positive thing most days, walked outside twice, messaged an old workmate, and wrote in her diary on a couple of occasions. She notes that these activities provided brief moments of relief or normalcy, though the overall impact was subtle. Messaging a friend made her feel both lighter and somewhat anxious. Sleep remains inconsistent; she sometimes scrolls on her phone late at night despite attempts to reduce screen time, but found that reading a magazine instead helped her mind wander less. Appetite is still poor, with frequent skipped meals and only occasional small portions eaten, often when prompted by her children. Alison continues to feel guilty about her perceived lack of engagement with her children and work, having missed a shift due to low motivation. She describes her relationship with her partner, Dave, as distant, and feels both lonely and somewhat relieved by his absence. She has not had thoughts of self-harm or active hopelessness, though she does feel overwhelmed at times. Alison identifies her sister as a key support, with regular visits and phone calls providing some comfort. She expresses ongoing worries about finances and the possibility that her current state may not improve.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Affect: Flat to mildly reactive; able to express some positive emotions when discussing children and sister.\n- Speech: Normal rate and tone, coherent.\n- Thought process: Logical, though content reflects low mood and self-criticism.\n- Sleep: Fragmented, with some improvement when reducing screen time.\n- Appetite: Decreased, with minimal intake.\n- Energy: Low, with occasional brief bursts of activity.\n- Social: Maintains some contact with family and friends; limited engagement at work.\n- No evidence of psychosis, mania, or active suicidal ideation.\n- No medication currently prescribed.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAlison continues to experience symptoms consistent with moderate major depressive disorder, including persistent low mood, anhedonia, low energy, poor sleep, reduced appetite, and feelings of guilt and worthlessness. She is making incremental progress with behavioral activation strategies, such as journaling, walking, and reaching out to others, though the benefits are subtle and not yet sustained. Protective factors include strong support from her sister and children, willingness to engage in therapy, and absence of suicidal ideation. Stressors include financial insecurity, reduced work hours, and relationship difficulties with her partner. No current pharmacological intervention.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Continue weekly psychotherapy sessions focused on behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and social support.\n- Encourage Alison to maintain daily journaling of positive experiences, aim for at least one walk per week, and use music or podcasts in the evening as a relaxation strategy.\n- Support gradual communication with her partner, starting with written messages if face-to-face feels overwhelming.\n- Reinforce the importance of reaching out to her sister or clinician if mood worsens or if thoughts of self-harm emerge.\n- Discuss practical supports for financial stress and community resources at the next session.\n- No medication indicated at this time; continue to monitor for any changes in mood, sleep, appetite, or safety concerns.\n- Next appointment scheduled for the same time next week. Alison is encouraged to reach out sooner if needed.",
