I understand that balancing school, work, and personal life can be quite challenging, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. To start, I\u2019d like to hear about what brought you in today\u2014what's been on your mind or what you'd like to focus on during our time together?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, thank you. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling really tired all the time, even though I sleep a lot. It\u2019s hard to concentrate in class, and I feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I also feel kind of guilty because I can\u2019t do more for my family, and I worry a lot about failing. Sometimes, I just want to give up, but I don\u2019t know how to talk about it with anyone."

It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of guilt and worry about your family and your academic performance. These feelings can be very heavy to carry. \n\nWhen you mention feeling like giving up, can you tell me more about what that looks like for you? Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess... sometimes I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, no matter how hard I try, I still mess up or fall behind. When I get those thoughts, I start thinking maybe I should just stop trying altogether. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t see the point sometimes, and I feel really alone with these feelings.

It sounds like these thoughts are quite persistent and might be contributing to how you're feeling physically and emotionally. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking like that, do you also observe any particular physical sensations or emotions that come up? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."

It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with these physical and emotional experiences. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like these feelings have been persistent and affecting your daily life. Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

Those thoughts about not being good enough and fearing disappointment are very common among people experiencing similar feelings, but they can also be quite painful. \n\nIt sounds like these beliefs might be contributing to your feelings of fatigue, anxiety, and hopelessness. Would you be open to exploring these thoughts a bit more, to see how they might be influencing how you feel and behave?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess so. I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way before. I just feel like I have to be perfect all the time, or I\u2019ll let everyone down. But maybe those thoughts aren\u2019t entirely true. I don\u2019t know how to change them, though."

Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always there, and I can\u2019t get away from them."

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I guess I can try. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

                  "clinician": "Great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a brief exercise together. When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Recognizing that the thought is there without immediately reacting to it is a valuable skill, even if it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very understandable feeling, Mei Lin. Feeling like you lack control can be very distressing. One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",
                  "patient": "Sure, I\u2019ll try. I see my phone, a cup of tea, my notebook, a plant, and my window. That\u2019s five things. I guess I\u2019m trying to focus on what\u2019s here right now. It\u2019s a little distracting, but I\u2019ll keep going."

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a wonderful observation, Mei Lin. Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very good plan, Mei Lin. Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",

You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall?

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that, Mei Lin. Those thoughts about not being good enough and fearing disappointment are very common among people experiencing similar feelings, but they can also be quite painful. \n\nIt sounds like these beliefs might be contributing to your feelings of fatigue, anxiety, and hopelessness. Would you be open to exploring these thoughts a bit more, to see how they might be influencing how you feel and behave?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try. I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way before. I just feel like I have to be perfect all the time, or I\u2019ll let everyone down. But maybe those thoughts aren\u2019t entirely true. I don\u2019t know how to change them, though."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by the pressure to be perfect, especially when you\u2019re carrying so much responsibility and worry. Recognizing that these thoughts might not be entirely true is a really important insight. \n\nIn therapy, we often work on identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts like these, and finding more balanced ways of thinking. Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always there, and I can\u2019t get away from them."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very common experience, Mei Lin. These thoughts can feel persistent and hard to shake. One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a brief exercise together. When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very insightful observation, Mei Lin. Recognizing that the thought is there without immediately reacting to it is a valuable skill, even if it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment. \n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. Feeling like you lack control can be very distressing. One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm. \n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a simple grounding exercise together. It\u2019s called the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",
                  "patient": "Sure, I\u2019ll try. I see my phone, a cup of tea, my notebook, a plant, and my window. That\u2019s five things. I guess I\u2019m trying to focus on what\u2019s here right now. It\u2019s a little distracting, but I\u2019ll keep going."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Excellent, Mei Lin. You\u2019re doing a great job of grounding yourself by focusing on your senses. Now, can you tell me about what you\u2019re feeling or touching right now?",
                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a wonderful observation, Mei Lin. Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very good plan, Mei Lin. Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Those are very thoughtful and practical goals, Mei Lin. Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to take small steps. I'm here to support you along the way, and I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. See you then.",

Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",

When I get those thoughts, I start thinking maybe I should just stop trying altogether. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t see the point sometimes, and I feel really alone with these feelings.

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky.

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now?

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse.

Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

                  "clinician": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

Even small movements like stretching or a brief walk can sometimes help break the cycle of negative thoughts and provide a bit of relief. It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",
                  "patient": "I think having a reminder could help, yeah. Sometimes I forget what I\u2019m supposed to do when I\u2019m feeling really down. Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that. I just don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m failing again if I can\u2019t do everything perfectly."

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I could do that. Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget. I guess I just need to remind myself that it\u2019s okay to take small breaks."

Gentle, simple phrases like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself\u201d can serve as kind reminders that self-care doesn\u2019t have to be complicated or perfect. They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to keep practicing the grounding and the reminders. Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re focusing on understanding your emotions better\u2014this can be a powerful step toward feeling more in control and less overwhelmed.\n\nWould you like some suggestions on how to structure your journaling, or any prompts that might help you get started? And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently. I\u2019ll try to include those in my journaling. Thanks for the suggestions."

Including prompts like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d and \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d can indeed help shift your focus toward the positive aspects of your day, which is a helpful perspective to cultivate. Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can do that. I\u2019ll try to keep up with the grounding exercises, use the notes, and journal each evening.

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It\u2019s understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. Progress with managing feelings of depression and fatigue can often be gradual, and it\u2019s common to have days where things feel more difficult. Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that, Mei Lin. It\u2019s very understandable to have those kinds of thoughts when you're feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Thank you for describing those sensations, Mei Lin. The heaviness in your chest, the anxiety, and the foggy feeling in your mind all sound very distressing. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with these physical and emotional experiences. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like these feelings have been persistent and affecting your daily life. Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired. It\u2019s like a cycle I can\u2019t break."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It sounds like academic pressures, worries about your family, and sleep difficulties are all interconnected and contributing to this cycle of distress. Recognizing these patterns is an important step. \n\nWhen you think about these stressors, do you notice any specific thoughts or beliefs that come up? For example, do you have certain ideas about what it means if you fail or fall behind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that, Mei Lin. Those thoughts about not being good enough and fearing disappointment are very common among people experiencing similar feelings, but they can also be quite painful. \n\nIt sounds like these beliefs might be contributing to your feelings of fatigue, anxiety, and hopelessness. Would you be open to exploring these thoughts a bit more, to see how they might be influencing how you feel and behave?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try. I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way before. I just feel like I have to be perfect all the time, or I\u2019ll let everyone down. But maybe those thoughts aren\u2019t entirely true. I don\u2019t know how to change them, though."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by the pressure to be perfect, especially when you\u2019re carrying so much responsibility and worry. Recognizing that these thoughts might not be entirely true is a really important insight. \n\nIn therapy, we often work on identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts like these, and finding more balanced ways of thinking. Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always there, and I can\u2019t get away from them."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very common experience, Mei Lin. These thoughts can feel persistent and hard to shake. One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a brief exercise together. When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very insightful observation, Mei Lin. Recognizing that the thought is there without immediately reacting to it is a valuable skill, even if it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment. \n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. Feeling like you lack control can be very distressing. One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm. \n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a simple grounding exercise together. It\u2019s called the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",
                  "patient": "Sure, I\u2019ll try. I see my phone, a cup of tea, my notebook, a plant, and my window. That\u2019s five things. I guess I\u2019m trying to focus on what\u2019s here right now. It\u2019s a little distracting, but I\u2019ll keep going."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Excellent, Mei Lin. You\u2019re doing a great job of grounding yourself by focusing on your senses. Now, can you tell me about what you\u2019re feeling or touching right now?",
                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a wonderful observation, Mei Lin. Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very good plan, Mei Lin. Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Those are very thoughtful and practical goals, Mei Lin. Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to take small steps. I'm here to support you along the way, and I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. See you then.",

It\u2019s hard to concentrate in class, and I feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I also feel kind of guilty because I can\u2019t do more for my family, and I worry a lot about failing.

These feelings can be very heavy to carry. \n\nWhen you mention feeling like giving up, can you tell me more about what that looks like for you? Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess... sometimes I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, no matter how hard I try, I still mess up or fall behind. When I get those thoughts, I start thinking maybe I should just stop trying altogether. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t see the point sometimes, and I feel really alone with these feelings.

It sounds like these thoughts are quite persistent and might be contributing to how you're feeling physically and emotionally. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking like that, do you also observe any particular physical sensations or emotions that come up? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very good plan, Mei Lin. Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing.

How have you been feeling overall?",

Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Remember, it\u2019s normal for progress to be gradual, especially when dealing with persistent feelings of tiredness and low mood. Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",
                  "patient": "I think having a reminder could help, yeah. Sometimes I forget what I\u2019m supposed to do when I\u2019m feeling really down. Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that.

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",

It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Progress with managing feelings of depression and fatigue can often be gradual, and it\u2019s common to have days where things feel more difficult. Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",

For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily?

You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall?

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

It\u2019s hard to concentrate in class, and I feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I also feel kind of guilty because I can\u2019t do more for my family, and I worry a lot about failing.

Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",

When I get those thoughts, I start thinking maybe I should just stop trying altogether. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t see the point sometimes, and I feel really alone with these feelings.

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",

It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",

I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

Even small movements like stretching or a brief walk can sometimes help break the cycle of negative thoughts and provide a bit of relief. It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",
                  "patient": "I think having a reminder could help, yeah. Sometimes I forget what I\u2019m supposed to do when I\u2019m feeling really down. Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that. I just don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m failing again if I can\u2019t do everything perfectly."

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

                  "clinician": "Hello Mei Lin, it's good to see you again. I appreciate you coming back for our fourth session. Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

                  "clinician": "It\u2019s understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. Progress with managing feelings of depression and fatigue can often be gradual, and it\u2019s common to have days where things feel more difficult. Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."

It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with these physical and emotional experiences. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like these feelings have been persistent and affecting your daily life. Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired. It\u2019s like a cycle I can\u2019t break."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. \n\nWhen you think about these stressors, do you notice any specific thoughts or beliefs that come up? For example, do you have certain ideas about what it means if you fail or fall behind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

Those thoughts about not being good enough and fearing disappointment are very common among people experiencing similar feelings, but they can also be quite painful. \n\nIt sounds like these beliefs might be contributing to your feelings of fatigue, anxiety, and hopelessness. Would you be open to exploring these thoughts a bit more, to see how they might be influencing how you feel and behave?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try. I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way before. I just feel like I have to be perfect all the time, or I\u2019ll let everyone down. But maybe those thoughts aren\u2019t entirely true. I don\u2019t know how to change them, though."

Recognizing that these thoughts might not be entirely true is a really important insight. \n\nIn therapy, we often work on identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts like these, and finding more balanced ways of thinking. Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always there, and I can\u2019t get away from them."

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

                  "clinician": "Great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a brief exercise together. When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Recognizing that the thought is there without immediately reacting to it is a valuable skill, even if it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment. \n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

                  "clinician": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. Feeling like you lack control can be very distressing. One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm. \n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",
                  "patient": "Sure, I\u2019ll try. I see my phone, a cup of tea, my notebook, a plant, and my window. That\u2019s five things. I guess I\u2019m trying to focus on what\u2019s here right now. It\u2019s a little distracting, but I\u2019ll keep going."

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a wonderful observation, Mei Lin. Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very good plan, Mei Lin. Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very good plan, Mei Lin. Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",

Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that.

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day.

                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",

                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always there, and I can\u2019t get away from them."

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think.

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Progress with managing feelings of depression and fatigue can often be gradual, and it\u2019s common to have days where things feel more difficult. Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",

                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse.

Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very practical approach, Mei Lin. Even small movements like stretching or a brief walk can sometimes help break the cycle of negative thoughts and provide a bit of relief. It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",
                  "patient": "I think having a reminder could help, yeah. Sometimes I forget what I\u2019m supposed to do when I\u2019m feeling really down. Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that. I just don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m failing again if I can\u2019t do everything perfectly."

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I could do that. Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget. I guess I just need to remind myself that it\u2019s okay to take small breaks."

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to keep practicing the grounding and the reminders. Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently. I\u2019ll try to include those in my journaling. Thanks for the suggestions."

Including prompts like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d and \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d can indeed help shift your focus toward the positive aspects of your day, which is a helpful perspective to cultivate. Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can do that. I\u2019ll try to keep up with the grounding exercises, use the notes, and journal each evening.

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Remember, it\u2019s normal for progress to be gradual, especially when dealing with persistent feelings of tiredness and low mood. Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

Even small movements like stretching or a brief walk can sometimes help break the cycle of negative thoughts and provide a bit of relief. It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",
                  "patient": "I think having a reminder could help, yeah. Sometimes I forget what I\u2019m supposed to do when I\u2019m feeling really down. Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that.

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I could do that. Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget. I guess I just need to remind myself that it\u2019s okay to take small breaks."

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re focusing on understanding your emotions better\u2014this can be a powerful step toward feeling more in control and less overwhelmed.\n\nWould you like some suggestions on how to structure your journaling, or any prompts that might help you get started? And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently. I\u2019ll try to include those in my journaling. Thanks for the suggestions."

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",

For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."

It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with these physical and emotional experiences. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like these feelings have been persistent and affecting your daily life. Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired. It\u2019s like a cycle I can\u2019t break."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. \n\nWhen you think about these stressors, do you notice any specific thoughts or beliefs that come up? For example, do you have certain ideas about what it means if you fail or fall behind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

Those thoughts about not being good enough and fearing disappointment are very common among people experiencing similar feelings, but they can also be quite painful. \n\nIt sounds like these beliefs might be contributing to your feelings of fatigue, anxiety, and hopelessness. Would you be open to exploring these thoughts a bit more, to see how they might be influencing how you feel and behave?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess so. I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way before. I just feel like I have to be perfect all the time, or I\u2019ll let everyone down. But maybe those thoughts aren\u2019t entirely true. I don\u2019t know how to change them, though."

Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always there, and I can\u2019t get away from them."

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I guess I can try. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to.

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse.

Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",

Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily?

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."

It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with these physical and emotional experiences. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like these feelings have been persistent and affecting your daily life. Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

For example, do you have certain ideas about what it means if you fail or fall behind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

Would you be open to exploring these thoughts a bit more, to see how they might be influencing how you feel and behave?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try. I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way before. I just feel like I have to be perfect all the time, or I\u2019ll let everyone down. But maybe those thoughts aren\u2019t entirely true. I don\u2019t know how to change them, though."

Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think.

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",
                  "patient": "Sure, I\u2019ll try. I see my phone, a cup of tea, my notebook, a plant, and my window. That\u2019s five things. I guess I\u2019m trying to focus on what\u2019s here right now. It\u2019s a little distracting, but I\u2019ll keep going."

                  "clinician": "Excellent, Mei Lin. You\u2019re doing a great job of grounding yourself by focusing on your senses. Now, can you tell me about what you\u2019re feeling or touching right now?",
                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a wonderful observation, Mei Lin. Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very good plan, Mei Lin. Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Those are very thoughtful and practical goals, Mei Lin. Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky.

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think.

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",

Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse.

Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit.

Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies?

It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can do that. I\u2019ll try to keep up with the grounding exercises, use the notes, and journal each evening.

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Remember, it\u2019s normal for progress to be gradual, especially when dealing with persistent feelings of tiredness and low mood. Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",
                  "patient": "I think having a reminder could help, yeah. Sometimes I forget what I\u2019m supposed to do when I\u2019m feeling really down. Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that.

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I could do that. Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to keep practicing the grounding and the reminders. Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can do that. I\u2019ll try to keep up with the grounding exercises, use the notes, and journal each evening.

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Progress with managing feelings of depression and fatigue can often be gradual, and it\u2019s common to have days where things feel more difficult. Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."

It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with these physical and emotional experiences. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like these feelings have been persistent and affecting your daily life. Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Would you be open to exploring these thoughts a bit more, to see how they might be influencing how you feel and behave?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess so. I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way before. I just feel like I have to be perfect all the time, or I\u2019ll let everyone down. But maybe those thoughts aren\u2019t entirely true. I don\u2019t know how to change them, though."

Recognizing that these thoughts might not be entirely true is a really important insight. \n\nIn therapy, we often work on identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts like these, and finding more balanced ways of thinking. Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",

Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing.

How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse.

Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",

I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping.

For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference.

Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies?

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now?

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It\u2019s good to hear that the grounding exercises have provided some relief, even if only temporarily. Remember, it\u2019s normal for progress to be gradual, especially when dealing with persistent feelings of tiredness and low mood. Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that, Mei Lin. It sounds like those days are particularly tough, with feelings of frustration, self-doubt, and hopelessness taking over. Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That sounds incredibly challenging, Mei Lin. It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very practical approach, Mei Lin. Even small movements like stretching or a brief walk can sometimes help break the cycle of negative thoughts and provide a bit of relief. It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",
                  "patient": "I think having a reminder could help, yeah. Sometimes I forget what I\u2019m supposed to do when I\u2019m feeling really down. Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that. I just don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m failing again if I can\u2019t do everything perfectly."

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I could do that. Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget. I guess I just need to remind myself that it\u2019s okay to take small breaks."

Gentle, simple phrases like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself\u201d can serve as kind reminders that self-care doesn\u2019t have to be complicated or perfect. They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

Placing the notes where you\u2019ll see them during your daily activities can serve as gentle prompts to pause and care for yourself. Remember, it\u2019s okay if you forget sometimes or if it takes time to get used to these new habits\u2014what matters is your willingness to try and be kind to yourself along the way.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies to support your well-being and help you manage these difficult days. For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to keep practicing the grounding and the reminders. Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns. I hope that will help me feel a bit more in control."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very thoughtful and proactive goal, Mei Lin. Journaling even a few sentences about your feelings can be a valuable way to increase self-awareness and identify patterns over time. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re focusing on understanding your emotions better\u2014this can be a powerful step toward feeling more in control and less overwhelmed.\n\nWould you like some suggestions on how to structure your journaling, or any prompts that might help you get started? And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that. I just hope I can keep it up, even on days I feel really tired or down."

                  "clinician": "That sounds like a very reasonable and gentle approach, Mei Lin. Reflecting once a day in the evening can give you a consistent opportunity to check in with yourself. Prompts like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d and \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d are simple yet effective ways to guide your reflection. Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently. I\u2019ll try to include those in my journaling. Thanks for the suggestions."

Including prompts like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d and \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d can indeed help shift your focus toward the positive aspects of your day, which is a helpful perspective to cultivate. Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can do that. I\u2019ll try to keep up with the grounding exercises, use the notes, and journal each evening. It feels a little scary, but I want to try and see if it helps. Thank you for helping me come up with these ideas. I feel a bit more hopeful now."

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Progress with managing feelings of depression and fatigue can often be gradual, and it\u2019s common to have days where things feel more difficult. Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

                  "patient": "Um, okay. I guess I can try. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

                  "clinician": "Great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a brief exercise together. When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",

Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that.

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",

Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired. It\u2019s like a cycle I can\u2019t break."

                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it.

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

It\u2019s hard to concentrate in class, and I feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I also feel kind of guilty because I can\u2019t do more for my family, and I worry a lot about failing.

It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of guilt and worry about your family and your academic performance. These feelings can be very heavy to carry. \n\nWhen you mention feeling like giving up, can you tell me more about what that looks like for you? Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess... sometimes I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, no matter how hard I try, I still mess up or fall behind. When I get those thoughts, I start thinking maybe I should just stop trying altogether. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t see the point sometimes, and I feel really alone with these feelings.

It sounds like these thoughts are quite persistent and might be contributing to how you're feeling physically and emotionally. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking like that, do you also observe any particular physical sensations or emotions that come up? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think.

Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse.

Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies?

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",

Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",

You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it.

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always there, and I can\u2019t get away from them."

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

                  "clinician": "Great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a brief exercise together. When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very insightful observation, Mei Lin. Recognizing that the thought is there without immediately reacting to it is a valuable skill, even if it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment. \n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

                {
                  "clinician": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. Feeling like you lack control can be very distressing. One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm. \n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",
                  "patient": "Sure, I\u2019ll try. I see my phone, a cup of tea, my notebook, a plant, and my window. That\u2019s five things. I guess I\u2019m trying to focus on what\u2019s here right now. It\u2019s a little distracting, but I\u2019ll keep going."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Excellent, Mei Lin. You\u2019re doing a great job of grounding yourself by focusing on your senses. Now, can you tell me about what you\u2019re feeling or touching right now?",
                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a wonderful observation, Mei Lin. Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very good plan, Mei Lin. Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Those are very thoughtful and practical goals, Mei Lin. Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",

When I get those thoughts, I start thinking maybe I should just stop trying altogether. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t see the point sometimes, and I feel really alone with these feelings.

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky.

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now?

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time.

Remember, it\u2019s normal for progress to be gradual, especially when dealing with persistent feelings of tiredness and low mood. Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

Even small movements like stretching or a brief walk can sometimes help break the cycle of negative thoughts and provide a bit of relief. It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",
                  "patient": "I think having a reminder could help, yeah. Sometimes I forget what I\u2019m supposed to do when I\u2019m feeling really down. Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that. I just don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m failing again if I can\u2019t do everything perfectly."

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I could do that. Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to keep practicing the grounding and the reminders. Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently. I\u2019ll try to include those in my journaling. Thanks for the suggestions."

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can do that. I\u2019ll try to keep up with the grounding exercises, use the notes, and journal each evening.

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

                  "clinician": "Those are very thoughtful and practical goals, Mei Lin. Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Progress with managing feelings of depression and fatigue can often be gradual, and it\u2019s common to have days where things feel more difficult. Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with these physical and emotional experiences. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like these feelings have been persistent and affecting your daily life. Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired. It\u2019s like a cycle I can\u2019t break."

I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now?

                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily?

You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall?

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

I understand that balancing school, work, and personal life can be quite challenging, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. To start, I\u2019d like to hear about what brought you in today\u2014what's been on your mind or what you'd like to focus on during our time together?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, thank you. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling really tired all the time, even though I sleep a lot. It\u2019s hard to concentrate in class, and I feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I also feel kind of guilty because I can\u2019t do more for my family, and I worry a lot about failing. Sometimes, I just want to give up, but I don\u2019t know how to talk about it with anyone."

It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of guilt and worry about your family and your academic performance. These feelings can be very heavy to carry. \n\nWhen you mention feeling like giving up, can you tell me more about what that looks like for you? Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess... sometimes I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, no matter how hard I try, I still mess up or fall behind. When I get those thoughts, I start thinking maybe I should just stop trying altogether. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t see the point sometimes, and I feel really alone with these feelings.

It sounds like these thoughts are quite persistent and might be contributing to how you're feeling physically and emotionally. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking like that, do you also observe any particular physical sensations or emotions that come up? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired. It\u2019s like a cycle I can\u2019t break."

                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I guess I can try. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Recognizing that the thought is there without immediately reacting to it is a valuable skill, even if it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",

Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

Even small movements like stretching or a brief walk can sometimes help break the cycle of negative thoughts and provide a bit of relief. It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns. I hope that will help me feel a bit more in control."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very thoughtful and proactive goal, Mei Lin. Journaling even a few sentences about your feelings can be a valuable way to increase self-awareness and identify patterns over time. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re focusing on understanding your emotions better\u2014this can be a powerful step toward feeling more in control and less overwhelmed.\n\nWould you like some suggestions on how to structure your journaling, or any prompts that might help you get started? And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that. I just hope I can keep it up, even on days I feel really tired or down."

                  "clinician": "That sounds like a very reasonable and gentle approach, Mei Lin. Reflecting once a day in the evening can give you a consistent opportunity to check in with yourself. Prompts like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d and \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d are simple yet effective ways to guide your reflection. Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently. I\u2019ll try to include those in my journaling. Thanks for the suggestions."

Including prompts like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d and \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d can indeed help shift your focus toward the positive aspects of your day, which is a helpful perspective to cultivate. Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can do that. I\u2019ll try to keep up with the grounding exercises, use the notes, and journal each evening. It feels a little scary, but I want to try and see if it helps. Thank you for helping me come up with these ideas. I feel a bit more hopeful now."

It's completely normal to feel a bit scared when trying new strategies, but your willingness to give them a try is a strong and positive step forward. Remember, progress takes time, and each small effort counts. I'm here to support you along the way, and I look forward to hearing about how these practices work for you in our next session. \n\nTake care, and see you next time.",

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with these physical and emotional experiences. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like these feelings have been persistent and affecting your daily life. Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",

                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always there, and I can\u2019t get away from them."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very common experience, Mei Lin. These thoughts can feel persistent and hard to shake. One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a brief exercise together. When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very insightful observation, Mei Lin. Recognizing that the thought is there without immediately reacting to it is a valuable skill, even if it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment. \n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. Feeling like you lack control can be very distressing. One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm. \n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a simple grounding exercise together. It\u2019s called the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",
                  "patient": "Sure, I\u2019ll try. I see my phone, a cup of tea, my notebook, a plant, and my window. That\u2019s five things. I guess I\u2019m trying to focus on what\u2019s here right now. It\u2019s a little distracting, but I\u2019ll keep going."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Excellent, Mei Lin. You\u2019re doing a great job of grounding yourself by focusing on your senses. Now, can you tell me about what you\u2019re feeling or touching right now?",
                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a wonderful observation, Mei Lin. Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very good plan, Mei Lin. Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Those are very thoughtful and practical goals, Mei Lin. Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",

Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

Recognizing that these thoughts might not be entirely true is a really important insight. \n\nIn therapy, we often work on identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts like these, and finding more balanced ways of thinking. Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I guess I can try. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

                  "clinician": "Great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a brief exercise together. When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm.\n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think. It\u2019s kind of calming to just notice these things. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was missing by not paying attention to the present."

Noticing these sensations can indeed help bring a sense of calm and presence, especially when feelings of overwhelm are strong. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re experiencing some of that calming effect. \n\nWould you like to continue with the exercise, or explore other strategies that might help you manage these difficult feelings when they come up?",
                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

Last time, we talked about some of the feelings of fatigue, worry, and the cycle of negative thoughts you're experiencing. You mentioned wanting to practice grounding exercises and journaling to help manage your emotions. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you had a chance to try any of these strategies? How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."

It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",

Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that.

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",

Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired. It\u2019s like a cycle I can\u2019t break."

                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it.

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

It\u2019s hard to concentrate in class, and I feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I also feel kind of guilty because I can\u2019t do more for my family, and I worry a lot about failing.

It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of guilt and worry about your family and your academic performance. These feelings can be very heavy to carry. \n\nWhen you mention feeling like giving up, can you tell me more about what that looks like for you? Are there specific moments or thoughts that come up when you feel that way?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess... sometimes I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, no matter how hard I try, I still mess up or fall behind. When I get those thoughts, I start thinking maybe I should just stop trying altogether. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t see the point sometimes, and I feel really alone with these feelings.

It sounds like these thoughts are quite persistent and might be contributing to how you're feeling physically and emotionally. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking like that, do you also observe any particular physical sensations or emotions that come up? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy.

Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired.

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky.

When you notice those thoughts about not being good enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment.\n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now?

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think.

                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

How have you been feeling overall?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."

Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",

Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."

Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse.

Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."

Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies?

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",

Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget.

Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns.

And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that.

Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently.

Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",

You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall?

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",

                  "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I tried the grounding exercise a few times when I felt really anxious or overwhelmed. It did help a little, especially focusing on what I could see and feel. But honestly, sometimes I forget to do it, or I feel too tired to even remember. Overall, I think I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better, but there are still days when I just feel really down and tired all the time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any real progress, but I\u2019m trying."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It\u2019s good to hear that the grounding exercises have provided some relief, even if only temporarily. Remember, it\u2019s normal for progress to be gradual, especially when dealing with persistent feelings of tiredness and low mood. Trying your best and staying consistent with these strategies is already a positive step. \n\nYou mentioned feeling down and tired on some days\u2014can you tell me more about what those days are like for you? Are there specific thoughts or situations that tend to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think on those days, I just feel like I can't do anything right. Like, even if I try to focus on my work or study, my mind just feels foggy, and I get frustrated. Sometimes, I start thinking that maybe I\u2019m not smart enough or that I\u2019ll never catch up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. And then, I just feel really tired and hopeless."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that, Mei Lin. It sounds like those days are particularly tough, with feelings of frustration, self-doubt, and hopelessness taking over. Recognizing these patterns is an important step. When you notice yourself slipping into these negative thoughts, do you find that they tend to reinforce your feelings of fatigue and hopelessness? Or do they sometimes lead to specific behaviors, like withdrawing or avoiding your work?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think they do make me feel more tired and hopeless. When I start thinking I\u2019m not good enough, I just want to give up and stop trying. I tend to avoid my assignments or just sit there feeling stuck. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to talk to anyone because I feel like I\u2019ll just bother them or make things worse. It\u2019s like, the more I think I\u2019m failing, the harder it is to do anything about it."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "That sounds incredibly challenging, Mei Lin. It\u2019s understandable that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of avoidance and deepen your feelings of hopelessness. Recognizing that these thoughts lead to withdrawal and make it harder to move forward is an important insight. \n\nIn our previous session, we discussed some strategies like mindfulness and grounding exercises. Do you think these techniques have helped at all during those difficult moments? Or are there other approaches you feel might be more helpful for you right now?",
                  "patient": "I think the grounding exercises help a little, but only for a short time. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to focus on my senses, and I forget to do it. I\u2019ve also tried to write in my journal, but I don\u2019t always know what to say or if it\u2019s helping. Sometimes, I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in my head, and nothing really makes a difference. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything else I should try."
                },
                {
                  "clinician": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. When you're overwhelmed, it can be difficult to remember or even believe that these strategies will help, especially when the feelings of being stuck persist. Sometimes, in those moments, it can be helpful to have a set of simple, quick actions you can do without much effort\u2014things that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nWould you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques or small steps you might take when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? For example, some people find that brief physical activity, like stretching or a short walk, or even just changing your environment temporarily, can make a difference. Or perhaps we can work on some specific thought-challenging exercises to help you reframe those negative beliefs about yourself. What do you think might be worth trying next?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try taking a quick walk or stretching when I feel overwhelmed. It might help to get out of my head for a bit. But I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t remember to do it, or I\u2019ll feel too tired to move. I don\u2019t know if that will really make a difference, but I\u2019m willing to try."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very practical approach, Mei Lin. Even small movements like stretching or a brief walk can sometimes help break the cycle of negative thoughts and provide a bit of relief. It\u2019s understandable to worry about remembering or feeling too tired\u2014these are common challenges. \n\nOne idea might be to set a simple reminder for yourself, like a note or an alarm, to prompt you to take that break when you start feeling overwhelmed. Over time, these small actions can become part of your routine, and you might find that they help you feel a little more in control. \n\nWould you like to work together on creating a plan or some specific cues to help you remember these strategies? Or is there another approach you\u2019re curious about exploring?",
                  "patient": "I think having a reminder could help, yeah. Sometimes I forget what I\u2019m supposed to do when I\u2019m feeling really down. Maybe if I had a note or something to remind me to take a break or do a quick stretch, it would be easier. I\u2019m willing to try that. I just don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m failing again if I can\u2019t do everything perfectly."

Using reminders or notes is a gentle way to support yourself without adding pressure. It\u2019s about creating a safety net, not a perfect system. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or cues for your reminder note? For example, something like \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d or \u201cStretch for a few minutes\u201d\u2014something simple and encouraging? Or perhaps a visual cue that feels comforting or motivating to you?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I could do that. Maybe I can write something like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself.\u201d I want it to be simple and kind, not something that makes me feel worse if I forget. I guess I just need to remind myself that it\u2019s okay to take small breaks."

Gentle, simple phrases like \u201cJust breathe and stretch\u201d or \u201cTake a moment for yourself\u201d can serve as kind reminders that self-care doesn\u2019t have to be complicated or perfect. They can help you be more compassionate toward yourself, especially during tough days. \n\nWould you like to think about where you might place these notes\u2014perhaps on your desk, in your notebook, or somewhere you\u2019ll see them often? And how about setting a small goal to check in with yourself using these reminders a few times a day?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can put the notes on my desk and in my notebook. That way, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m studying or working. I\u2019ll try to check in with myself a few times a day, like you said. It might help me remember to pause and breathe, even when I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll give it a try."

Placing the notes where you\u2019ll see them during your daily activities can serve as gentle prompts to pause and care for yourself. Remember, it\u2019s okay if you forget sometimes or if it takes time to get used to these new habits\u2014what matters is your willingness to try and be kind to yourself along the way.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies to support your well-being and help you manage these difficult days. For now, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking these small but meaningful steps. \n\nWould you like to set some specific goals for the next week, or discuss anything else before we wrap up today?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to keep practicing the grounding and the reminders. Maybe I can also try to journal a little more, even if it\u2019s just a few sentences about how I\u2019m feeling. I want to understand my feelings better and see if I notice any patterns. I hope that will help me feel a bit more in control."

                  "clinician": "That\u2019s a very thoughtful and proactive goal, Mei Lin. Journaling even a few sentences about your feelings can be a valuable way to increase self-awareness and identify patterns over time. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re focusing on understanding your emotions better\u2014this can be a powerful step toward feeling more in control and less overwhelmed.\n\nWould you like some suggestions on how to structure your journaling, or any prompts that might help you get started? And how often do you think you might want to do this\u2014once a day, a few times a week?",
                  "patient": "Maybe I can try writing once a day, maybe in the evening, to reflect on how I felt that day. I think having some prompts would help, like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d or \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d I\u2019ll see if I can do that. I just hope I can keep it up, even on days I feel really tired or down."

                  "clinician": "That sounds like a very reasonable and gentle approach, Mei Lin. Reflecting once a day in the evening can give you a consistent opportunity to check in with yourself. Prompts like \u201cWhat was I feeling today?\u201d and \u201cWhat thoughts came up?\u201d are simple yet effective ways to guide your reflection. Remember, it\u2019s okay if some days are more challenging than others\u2014what matters is your willingness to keep trying, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few more prompts for your journaling, or tips on how to make it easier to stick with this habit?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d appreciate some more prompts. Maybe something like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d or \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d I think focusing on small positives could help me see things differently. I\u2019ll try to include those in my journaling. Thanks for the suggestions."

Including prompts like \u201cDid I notice any positive moments today?\u201d and \u201cWhat small thing made me feel a little better?\u201d can indeed help shift your focus toward the positive aspects of your day, which is a helpful perspective to cultivate. Recognizing small positives can build resilience and gradually improve your overall outlook.\n\nRemember, journaling is a personal process, so feel free to adapt these prompts or add new ones that resonate with you. The key is consistency and kindness toward yourself, especially on days when it feels harder to do.\n\nAs we wrap up today, do you feel comfortable with the plan to practice grounding, use your reminders, and journal daily? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we finish?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I can do that. I\u2019ll try to keep up with the grounding exercises, use the notes, and journal each evening. It feels a little scary, but I want to try and see if it helps. Thank you for helping me come up with these ideas. I feel a bit more hopeful now."

Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse.

For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",

                  "patient": "I think I\u2019d like to keep practicing this. It feels a little better when I focus on what\u2019s around me instead of my thoughts. Maybe I can do this when I start feeling overwhelmed again."

Practicing grounding techniques like this can be a helpful tool to manage overwhelming feelings and bring you back to the present moment. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you\u2019re finding some relief through this exercise.\n\nAs we continue working together, we can also explore other strategies and support systems that might help you feel more in control and less isolated. For now, I think it\u2019s a good point to pause and reflect on what we\u2019ve discussed today. \n\nBefore we wrap up, what are some goals or things you hope to work on before our next session?",
                  "patient": "I think I want to try using the grounding exercise more when I feel really anxious or sad. Maybe I can also journal about my thoughts and feelings, like I used to. I\u2019d like to understand my feelings better and find ways to handle them without feeling so overwhelmed. I hope I can get a little more energy and focus, too."

Using grounding exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety and sadness, and journaling can be a valuable way to explore and understand your feelings better. Improving your energy and focus is also a meaningful goal, especially given how much you're balancing.\n\nWe can work together on developing a plan to incorporate these strategies into your daily routine, and I can support you in finding additional coping skills that suit you. Does that sound like a good direction for our next steps?",
                  "patient": "Yes, that sounds good. I think having a plan would help me feel a little more in control. Thank you for listening and for your suggestions. I\u2019ll try to practice these things before our next session."

                  "clinician": "Hello Mei Lin, it's good to see you again. I appreciate you coming back for our fourth session. Last time, we discussed some of the strategies you've been trying, like grounding exercises, journaling, and using reminders to manage feelings of overwhelm and negative thoughts. You mentioned that these have helped a little, but some days still feel very tough, and you experience feelings of fatigue, frustration, and hopelessness. \n\nSince our last meeting, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling overall? Have any of the strategies you tried made a difference, even if just a little?",
                  "patient": "Hi, um, I think I have been a little better sometimes. The grounding exercises do help me feel a bit calmer, especially when I remember to do them. But honestly, on some days, I still feel really tired and down, like nothing is changing much. I try to use the reminders and journal, but I forget or just feel too overwhelmed to do it. So, I guess I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any real progress yet."

                  "clinician": "It\u2019s understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. Progress with managing feelings of depression and fatigue can often be gradual, and it\u2019s common to have days where things feel more difficult. Recognizing that the grounding exercises help you feel calmer is a positive sign, even if the overall mood still fluctuates. \n\nWhen you find yourself feeling really tired and down, are there particular thoughts or feelings that tend to come up most often? Or specific situations that seem to make those feelings worse?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I feel really tired and down, I start thinking that I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, I still mess up or fall behind. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a failure, and that I\u2019ll never catch up or do well enough. It\u2019s like, I get stuck in that kind of thinking, and it makes me feel even worse. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time."

                  "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that, Mei Lin. It\u2019s very understandable to have those kinds of thoughts when you're feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Feeling like you're not good enough and being stuck in that cycle can be really tough. Recognizing these thoughts is an important step. \n\nWhen you notice yourself thinking that way, do you also observe any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts? For example, do you feel tightness, sadness, or anything else in your body or mind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I think I feel a kind of heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. Sometimes I get really anxious, and my stomach feels upset. I also feel kind of numb, like I don\u2019t really feel anything, even when I try to focus or do my work. It\u2019s like my mind is just blank or foggy. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal, but it\u2019s been like this for a while."

                  "clinician": "Thank you for describing those sensations, Mei Lin. The heaviness in your chest, the anxiety, and the foggy feeling in your mind all sound very distressing. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with these physical and emotional experiences. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like these feelings have been persistent and affecting your daily life. Have you noticed if certain situations or thoughts tend to trigger or worsen these feelings?",
                  "patient": "Um, I think... when I have a lot of assignments due or if I think about my family and how I can't support them enough, it gets worse. Also, if I don\u2019t sleep well, everything feels more intense. Sometimes, just thinking about failing or disappointing people makes me feel even more anxious and tired. It\u2019s like a cycle I can\u2019t break."

                  "clinician": "It sounds like academic pressures, worries about your family, and sleep difficulties are all interconnected and contributing to this cycle of distress. Recognizing these patterns is an important step. \n\nWhen you think about these stressors, do you notice any specific thoughts or beliefs that come up? For example, do you have certain ideas about what it means if you fail or fall behind?",
                  "patient": "Yeah, I guess I often think that if I fail or don\u2019t do well, I\u2019m just not good enough. Like, I\u2019m not smart enough or strong enough to handle everything. I worry that I\u2019ll disappoint my family or make them ashamed. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for this, and I wonder if I should just give up."

                  "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that, Mei Lin. Those thoughts about not being good enough and fearing disappointment are very common among people experiencing similar feelings, but they can also be quite painful. \n\nIt sounds like these beliefs might be contributing to your feelings of fatigue, anxiety, and hopelessness. Would you be open to exploring these thoughts a bit more, to see how they might be influencing how you feel and behave?",
                  "patient": "Um, I guess I could try. I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way before. I just feel like I have to be perfect all the time, or I\u2019ll let everyone down. But maybe those thoughts aren\u2019t entirely true. I don\u2019t know how to change them, though."

Recognizing that these thoughts might not be entirely true is a really important insight. \n\nIn therapy, we often work on identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts like these, and finding more balanced ways of thinking. Would you be interested in exploring some strategies to do that, or perhaps learning some ways to cope when these thoughts come up?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always there, and I can\u2019t get away from them."

One approach we can consider is learning to observe these thoughts without immediately reacting to them\u2014kind of like watching clouds pass by in the sky. This can help create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don\u2019t feel so overwhelming. \n\nWould you like to try a simple exercise now, where we practice noticing these thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
                  "patient": "Um, okay. I\u2019ve never really done that before, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

                  "clinician": "Great, Mei Lin. Let\u2019s try a brief exercise together. When you notice those thoughts about not being enough or feeling like giving up, see if you can observe them as just thoughts\u2014like passing clouds\u2014without judging or trying to change them right away. \n\nTake a deep breath, and as you do, acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. For example, you might think, \u201cThere\u2019s that thought again, about not being enough,\u201d and then gently let it pass. \n\nWould you like to describe what you\u2019re noticing as you try this?",
                  "patient": "Okay, I\u2019ll try. Um, I\u2019m noticing that the thought about not being enough keeps coming back, but I\u2019m trying not to judge it. It\u2019s kind of like, I see it there, but I don\u2019t have to believe it or get upset about it. It\u2019s hard, though. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better."

Recognizing that the thought is there without immediately reacting to it is a valuable skill, even if it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s normal for these thoughts to keep coming back\u2014what matters is that you\u2019re practicing noticing them without judgment. \n\nOver time, this can help reduce their power over you. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies or thoughts that might help you when these feelings and thoughts become overwhelming?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like that. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any control over these feelings, so any tips would be helpful."

                  "clinician": "It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mei Lin. Feeling like you lack control can be very distressing. One approach we can consider is developing some small, manageable actions you can take when these feelings arise\u2014things that can help you regain a sense of control and calm. \n\nFor example, simple breathing exercises, grounding techniques, or even just taking a brief break to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise now, to see how it feels?",
                  "patient": "Yes, I\u2019d like to try. I\u2019ve heard about grounding exercises before, but I\u2019ve never really done one. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot."

The idea is to focus on your senses to bring your attention to the present moment. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Name five things you can see around you.\n- Then, four things you can touch or feel.\n- Next, three things you can hear.\n- Then, two things you can smell.\n- And finally, one thing you can taste or that you notice in your mouth.\n\nWould you like to try it now? If so, you can start by describing what you see around you.",

                  "patient": "Um, I feel the smooth surface of my phone in my hand, and the coolness of the air coming through the window. My legs are a bit numb from sitting too long, I think.
