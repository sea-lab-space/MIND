Okay, so I understand that you first went to your GP, who referred you here about two months ago. Can I ask what led you to go to the GP in the first place?",
          "patient": "My long-term boyfriend broke up with me and it was, it was such a shock, like I really wasn't expecting it. It just got me really down. I felt really lonely. And I didn't really want to see people. I just wanted to be in my own space. My mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and he's referred me to you."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay? So it sounds like you had that breakup and you weren't expecting it, so it kind of came out of the blue a bit and you've been on your own quite a lot. So you're not been seeing people as much. And it sounds like your mum noticed that there's been a bit of a change in you. Okay, and how have things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the GP?",
          "patient": "I just, nothing's really changed. Nothing's really improved. I just... I feel down, like everything's an effort and feel distant from things. And like I said, I can't snap out of it."

        {
          "clinician": "Okay, and how did you feel about coming here today?",
          "patient": "I was kind of disappointed in myself because I feel like nobody else my age is doing this. I should have been able to snap out of it, like it's just another thing that I've not really... you know, things that's making me stand out for the wrong reasons."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so you feel like it's kind of odd or unusual to be coming to see a clinical psychologist. I suppose I just want to reassure you that it's absolutely normal to have feelings of depression and anxiety. It's really very common, and it certainly isn't odd or strange at all. So it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today. So what I guess led you to do that? Because it sounds like maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you've managed to come anyway.",
          "patient": "I'm just hoping that it's going to help. I think I didn't really want to admit it because, like, it's just another failure, but my mum was talking to me and she's not really happy with the way I'm behaving. I didn't really want to disappoint her again. And so I thought there's no harm in it. So I came."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So it sounds like partly you're doing it then for your mum because you're a bit worried that she isn't pleased with you at the moment.",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "Well, I think it's great that you've come here. And definitely there's a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression, and particularly the type of therapy that we're gonna be doing, which is called cognitive behavior therapy. I'll tell you a bit more about that as we go on, but I'm just trying to find out a bit more about you today. So I saw from your notes that you're a medic student.",
          "patient": "Yeah? I'm not currently in uni at the moment, but yeah, last year I was a medical student."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so I guess why, what's the reason that you're not in uni this year?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so just thinking, so that would be about 6 months ago, was it that your year out started? And it sounds then maybe like your first year was also quite tough?",
          "patient": "Yeah, it was. I thought it's tough for everyone, but obviously we all take it in different ways, don't we."
        },
        {

        {
          "clinician": "But you don't sound too sure about that.",
          "patient": "No, though I think returning is probably... that's what's going to make everyone happy. And I think, you know, at least I'll be able to finally achieve something and get something right. So yeah, like next year I'm going to... I'll get through that. Yeah."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so it doesn't sound like you want to go back.",
          "patient": "I do. I didn't enjoy it. I just... I just don't feel like me at the moment. And I just, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of pressure. But that's what comes with it. And, you know, it'll work out for the best if I go."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so I guess then there's quite a lot of thoughts and feelings about going back at the moment. I'm just wondering, in the meantime, what are you up to, what have you been doing?",
          "patient": "Well, I haven't really had much on the horizon. My mom, her friends own a restaurant and she suggested that I did a bit of waitressing there, just doing it for a bit of money and stuff because obviously I'm not in uni, so you know, I've done that."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, how many shifts have you done there?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, when was that shift?",
          "patient": "It was last week, actually."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, and how was it? I suppose I'm intrigued, can you tell me a bit more about that?",
          "patient": "It was, it was different, you know, because it was like... I did enjoy it because it's just a different aspect and I had to speak to people and try to get their orders and try to remember it and stuff. I wasn't very good, but I suppose it was handy to have some money, like get out of the house."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So it sounds like you quite enjoyed that. Then what makes you think you weren't very good?",
          "patient": "I just felt slow. And people, sometimes they didn't understand what I was saying, so I'd have to talk louder or quieter, slower. And I got a bit confused sometimes with the orders, and I just don't really think that I'm not really like a friendly... like people don't really think that I'm a friendly person, so they didn't really want to talk to me and stuff. I felt like I was inconveniencing them, by like asking them things and getting things wrong. Yeah, they said that apparently most people get like a few mistakes on their first shift, but then again, she's my mom's friend, so that's probably why she's saying it."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So the person who owns the restaurant is your mum's friend. Okay, so you're saying that you think you weren't very good, and that's because you were a bit slow and you got confused with some orders. But you said it's common for people to do that on that first shift. That's what she said to you, but...",
          "patient": "But it's probably just she's just trying to make me feel better. She probably felt sorry for me because I'm obviously not very good at it, like I'm not very good at anything recently. I think she just felt sorry for me."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so I've just been noting down some of those thoughts that you've been having. You kind of say that you feel like you're not very good, you're slow, you're confused with the orders, and you feel like you're inconveniencing her and she feels sorry for you. I suppose I'm wondering, I mean, what makes you think that she feels sorry for you?",
          "patient": "Like I said, she's my mum's friend, and she's obviously feeling sorry for my mum as well because she's got a daughter that's not like anyone else of her age. And she's just like all alone and she's not getting involved. So I think she just feels sorry for me and she doesn't want, like, to upset me. But yeah."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "When you're having these kind of thoughts, because that's quite a lot of negative thoughts you're describing, how do you feel?",
          "patient": "Just feel empty, I don't... I'm just calling as it is. I'm just calling it as reality. I feel like I'm being honest with myself by just voicing it and not trying to get around hiding it because I know, like, I can see it in myself."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So it sounds like you feel like those thoughts are very true then? I mean, if you were going to write them... So I'm going to pick out some of those thoughts you describe. You said 'I'm not very good', and 'I'm inconveniencing them'. How much would you say you believe those on a scale out of 100, where 100 is like, I absolutely believe it and 0 is like, I don't believe it at all?",
          "patient": "I'm about 80, yeah."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So you feel quite sure that you definitely believe those, okay? And you said that when you're thinking those thoughts, you start to feel quite empty.",
          "patient": "I just feel distant and like I said, I'm not really myself, I just... It's like I'm not really there, but when I am, I can't even do a good job."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And are there any other emotions that you experience?",
          "patient": "I feel drained. I'd say I feel like I'm not in touch with anything, just... it's like everything's going on around me, but I'm just not there. I'm just, it's like I'm just watching."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so you feel empty, distant, you feel drained. And how, when you're feeling these emotions, how do you feel in your body? Kind of what sensations do you notice?",
          "patient": "I don't know how to describe it. I get like, I have a bit of like, like, you know, when you kind of get like butterflies when you're nervous and stuff, kind of get a bit of that."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "You feel some butterflies? Yeah, did you have butterflies that night when you were at the restaurant?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I was pretty nervous. Then when I got into it, they went away and like it distracted me for a bit. And so obviously I realized that I wasn't doing a very good job."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay? And you, when you have those emotions, how does it affect your energy levels? Do you feel more energetic, less energetic, or about the same when you feel down?",
          "patient": "Yeah, when you're having those emotions that you were describing... I just feel drained, like didn't even have like the energy to wake up in the morning sometimes, like I just felt pointless, like my body's heavy and I don't want to. Yeah."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So it sounds like you feel very tired. You're struggling to wake up. You said it's pointless. And what do you do then when you feel like that? So I guess you just talked about when you wake up in the morning and you feel heavy, and I suppose you've been maybe having some of these thoughts and those emotions potentially the night before, what do you then do? How do you respond to that?",
          "patient": "I just have to get up I suppose. I don't really have a choice because my mum, I live with my mom. I know it's hard for her, so I don't want her to be too worried. So I just... I just try to carry on as normal. It takes longer and I don't want to, but I do, so I'll go on with my routine."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So you're a bit slower in getting up, but you are still getting up anyway. And what about your kind of, what do you think about when you're doing that?",

          "clinician": "So it sounds like you think a bit more about the problem and you kind of spend time thinking about...",
          "patient": "How I hate it and I don't want to feel like this, but I do, and nobody else I know does. So it makes me feel even more alone and like getting me even more down. And I just don't want to disappoint anyone. I didn't really want it."

          "clinician": "And when you start telling yourself that kind of thing, how does that make you feel? Does that make you feel better afterwards or worse?",

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nGabriella, a young adult female and former medical student currently on a year out from university, presents with persistent low mood and difficulty functioning. She reports feeling \"down a lot\" and unable to \"snap out of it,\" which is a change from previous episodes of low mood where she was able to recover on her own. The onset of her current symptoms followed an unexpected breakup with her long-term boyfriend, which left her feeling shocked, lonely, and withdrawn. She has been isolating herself, spending most of her time at home, and her mother noticed a significant change in her behavior, prompting her to seek help. Gabriella expresses disappointment in herself for needing psychological support, feeling that her peers are not experiencing similar struggles. She describes her mood as empty, distant, and drained, with low energy and difficulty getting out of bed in the mornings. She experiences negative self-perceptions, believing she is \"not very good\" at things and is an inconvenience to others, with a strong conviction in these beliefs (80/100). She reports somatic symptoms such as \"butterflies\" when nervous and a general sense of heaviness and fatigue. Gabriella has recently tried a waitressing shift at her mother's friend's restaurant, which she found somewhat enjoyable but was overshadowed by self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy. She continues to live with her mother and feels pressure not to disappoint her. She is ambivalent about returning to university but feels obligated to do so to meet others' expectations. She denies any mention of suicidal ideation or self-harm in this session.\n\n**Objective:**  \nGabriella appears withdrawn and demonstrates low affect throughout the session. She is able to articulate her thoughts and feelings clearly, though her speech is marked by self-deprecating remarks and a lack of confidence. She reports significant anhedonia, low energy, and social withdrawal. She is compliant with her daily routine, albeit with difficulty. No psychomotor agitation or retardation is noted in the transcript. She has recently started a new activity (waitressing), which provided some distraction but did not improve her overall self-esteem. There is no evidence of psychosis, mania, or cognitive impairment. She is currently prescribed sertraline 50 mg once daily, as per her medication record.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella is experiencing a moderate to severe depressive episode, likely precipitated by a significant psychosocial stressor (relationship breakup) and compounded by academic stress and social isolation. Her symptoms include persistent low mood, anhedonia, low energy, negative self-appraisal, social withdrawal, and somatic complaints (fatigue, heaviness, butterflies). She demonstrates cognitive distortions typical of depression, such as overgeneralization and personalization. There is no evidence of psychosis or mania. She is at risk for further functional decline if symptoms persist, though there is no current indication of suicidal ideation or intent. She is currently being treated with sertraline 50 mg daily and is beginning cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Continue sertraline 50 mg once daily; monitor for efficacy and side effects.\n- Initiate a course of cognitive behavioral therapy, focusing on identifying and challenging negative automatic thoughts and behavioral activation.\n- Encourage gradual re-engagement in social and pleasurable activities, building on her recent experience with waitressing.\n- Explore Gabriella’s ambivalence about returning to university in future sessions, supporting her in making value-driven decisions.\n- Provide psychoeducation regarding depression, normalizing her experience and reducing self-stigma.\n- Involve family support as appropriate, given her close relationship with her mother.\n- Monitor for any emergence of suicidal ideation or self-harm.\n- Schedule follow-up in 1-2 weeks to assess response to medication and engagement with therapy.",

          "patient": "Um, it’s been kind of up and down. A little better some days, but I still feel pretty low most of the time."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that. You mentioned last time that you felt empty and drained, and that it was hard to get going in the mornings. Is that still how things feel?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I still feel really tired a lot. I have to force myself to get up, and I’m slow in the mornings. Some days I just want to stay in bed."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It sounds like those feelings of heaviness and fatigue are still really present for you. What’s helped you get up even when you don’t want to?",
          "patient": "Mostly just knowing my mom will worry if I don’t, and I don’t want her to feel bad. I feel like I have to keep going for her."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Looking after your mom’s feelings is important to you. How about for yourself—have you found anything that’s helpful for your own mood or energy?",
          "patient": "Not really, to be honest. I tried going on a walk one morning but I didn’t feel any better afterwards."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "I see, thank you for being honest about that. You’d mentioned trying waitressing at your mom’s friend’s restaurant. Have you had any more shifts there?",
          "patient": "I did one more shift. It was okay, but I still felt like I was messing up sometimes. I guess it’s nice to get out of the house, but I’m always nervous."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "What’s it like being around other people at work? Does it help at all, or is it mostly stressful?",
          "patient": "I think it’s a mix. When I’m busy I don’t think about feeling low as much. But if I make a mistake, I just feel like I’m letting people down again."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That sounds really tough. Are there any moments during your shift when you catch yourself feeling okay or distracted from those negative thoughts?",
          "patient": "Sometimes when I’m distracted, like running around or talking to someone, I don’t notice feeling bad. But it doesn’t last very long."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So, even brief periods of distraction might help reduce those feelings. Outside of work, have you noticed any situations where you feel even a little less down?",
          "patient": "Um, not really. I just mostly stay home, or I go to work and come back. I feel tired all the time so I don’t really do much else."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Given how tired you’re feeling, have you had any changes with your sleep since last time?",
          "patient": "I still can’t sleep very well. I just wake up a lot or don’t fall asleep for ages."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That sounds exhausting. On the nights where you do get some rest, do you notice any difference in your mood or energy the next day?",
          "patient": "Maybe slightly, but honestly I’m just still tired. Sometimes even if I sleep more, I don’t feel better."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Have you been able to keep a regular routine with your sleep, or is it inconsistent night to night?",
          "patient": "It’s really inconsistent. Some nights I’ll fall asleep early, other times I’m up super late on my phone. I scroll aimlessly. Then I feel bad the next day."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "When you’re up late on your phone, do you notice what kinds of things you’re doing, like social media, messaging, or something else?",
          "patient": "Mostly social media, I guess. Just scrolling, nothing important. Sometimes messaging but not really talking to anyone much."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that. Do you find being on your phone helps distract you from how you’re feeling, or does it make things worse?",
          "patient": "I think it distracts me for a bit, but then I end up feeling worse because I see other people doing stuff with friends, and I know I’m not."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That can be really tough—seeing other people’s lives, especially when you’re feeling alone. Have you tried reaching out to anyone, or has it felt too difficult?",
          "patient": "It feels hard. I messaged one uni friend a while ago but it fizzled out. I don’t really know what to say to people lately."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It sounds like it’s really hard to connect right now. When you imagine what you’d want to say if you did reach out, what comes to mind?",
          "patient": "I don’t know. I feel like I’d just complain, and I don’t want to drag other people down. Or I think they’d just think I’m boring."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a common worry, but it’s also understandable you’d want support. If a friend reached out to you feeling low, how would you respond?",
          "patient": "I think I’d just listen, and try to help if I could. I wouldn’t think they’re boring."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a really kind and supportive response. Do you think it’s possible your friends might feel similarly about you?",
          "patient": "Maybe. I just… it’s hard to believe it about myself, I guess."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It is hard when negative thoughts are so strong. Last session, we talked about how you often believe thoughts like 'I’m not very good' or 'I’m inconvenient.' Are those thoughts still coming up?",
          "patient": "Yes. Pretty much every day when I make a mistake, or even when I’m just at home and not doing much."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "What is it like to carry those thoughts with you so often?",
          "patient": "It’s exhausting. It makes everything feel heavier and pointless. Like I’m not going to get anything right, so what’s the point."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Have you found anything that helps soften those thoughts—maybe questioning them or trying to find evidence against them?",
          "patient": "Not really. I just feel like they’re true. I mean, I don’t have much proof things are different."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It’s really understandable to feel that way when you’re in this state. Sometimes, writing down those thoughts and looking at them later can help us get some distance. Would you be willing to try that this week?",
          "patient": "I could try. I’m not sure it’ll help, but I’ll try."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s all I’m asking—just to try. It’s a way to start noticing how automatic these thoughts are. Sometimes we notice patterns when we write them down. Would you like a specific way to do this, or just jot things as they come up?",
          "patient": "Maybe just jot them down? I don’t want to do anything complicated."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Of course, keep it simple. Maybe a note on your phone, or a piece of paper. Write down the negative thought when it happens, and if you notice what triggered it or how you felt, you can add that too, but only if you want to.",
          "patient": "Okay, I’ll give it a go."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Thanks, Gabriella. It’s a small step, but often these little steps build up over time. Apart from that, is there anything you’d like to explore or talk about today?",
          "patient": "I don’t know. I just… sometimes I feel like nothing’s ever going to get better, and it’s hard to imagine the future. Like I’ll be stuck like this forever."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Thank you for being open about that. When those thoughts come up, do you ever notice moments when you feel even a little hopeful, or is it all just heavy?",
          "patient": "It’s mostly just heavy. Maybe when I’m really distracted, but otherwise, I worry it’ll just always be like this."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "A lot of people with depression describe that sense of hopelessness. The truth is, with time and with support, things usually do change, even if it doesn’t feel possible in the moment. Is there anything that has helped you feel even a tiny bit better in the past, even just for a moment?",
          "patient": "Sometimes music helps. I don’t always feel like listening, but if I do, it can lift my mood a little."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a great observation. Would you feel comfortable to try listening to some music you like this week, just as a small act of self-care?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I can do that. Maybe when I go for a walk or something."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That sounds like a good plan. Even if your mood doesn’t change much, noticing small shifts can help over time. Do you prefer to walk inside, outside, or somewhere specific?",
          "patient": "I prefer outside, but I don’t have anywhere special to go. I just walk around the neighborhood."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s perfect. Even a short walk and some music is a positive step. Would you like to set a goal for how often you’d try this, or just see how it goes?",
          "patient": "Maybe just see how it goes. I don’t want to set myself up to fail if I can’t manage it."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a good approach. We’ll just check in next time about what you noticed, if anything. How are you finding your medication so far? Any side effects or concerns since starting sertraline?",
          "patient": "I think it’s okay. I haven’t noticed any major changes, maybe a little less anxious, but I still feel low most of the time."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It can sometimes take several weeks to notice full effects, but I’m glad to hear there are no serious side effects. Have you had any nausea, headaches, or trouble with appetite?",
          "patient": "Some nausea at first, but it’s better now. My appetite is about the same."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s good to hear. If you notice anything new, let me or your GP know. Are you finding it easy to remember to take your medication each day?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I just take it in the morning with breakfast."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Excellent. Keeping it part of your routine is helpful. Are there any other concerns or questions you want to talk about today?",
          "patient": "No, I think we covered most things. I just wish it’d all go away faster."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "I understand. Progress can be slow and frustrating, but you’re already taking important steps, even coming here today. We’ll keep working together and looking for small ways to support your recovery. Shall we plan to meet again in a week?",
          "patient": "Yes, that’s okay."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Great. Before we finish, could we summarize what we’ll work on this week? You’ll try to jot down negative thoughts when you notice them, and you might try listening to music, maybe while walking outside. Does that sound right?",
          "patient": "Yes, I’ll try those."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Thank you, Gabriella. I really appreciate your willingness to keep trying, even when things feel hard. I’ll see you next week and we’ll check in on how these small steps went. Take care until then.",

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nGabriella reports that her mood has been \"up and down\" since the last session, with some days feeling slightly better but overall continuing to feel \"pretty low most of the time.\" She describes persistent fatigue, difficulty getting up in the mornings, and a sense of heaviness and emptiness. Motivation to get out of bed is primarily driven by concern for her mother’s feelings rather than self-motivation. She attempted to improve her mood by going for a walk, but did not notice any benefit. Gabriella has worked another shift at her mom’s friend’s restaurant, which she found somewhat helpful for distraction, but she continues to feel nervous and worries about making mistakes and letting others down. Social interactions at work provide brief periods of distraction from negative thoughts, but these are short-lived.\n\nOutside of work, Gabriella spends most of her time at home and reports ongoing tiredness and low energy. Sleep remains problematic, with difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and inconsistent sleep patterns. She often stays up late on her phone, mostly scrolling through social media, which provides temporary distraction but ultimately worsens her mood due to social comparison and feelings of isolation. She has limited social contact and finds it difficult to reach out to friends, fearing she would be a burden or perceived as boring.\n\nGabriella continues to experience daily negative thoughts about herself, such as feeling \"not very good\" or \"inconvenient,\" which she finds exhausting and demoralizing. She has not found effective ways to challenge or soften these thoughts. She expresses a sense of hopelessness about the future and difficulty imagining improvement. Occasionally, listening to music provides a slight lift in mood, and she is open to trying this more intentionally as a self-care strategy.\n\nRegarding her medication (sertraline 50 mg daily), Gabriella reports no major side effects, with initial mild nausea that has since resolved. She has not noticed significant changes in mood but feels slightly less anxious. She is adherent to her medication, taking it each morning with breakfast.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Affect: Flat, with limited range; mood described as persistently low.\n- Thought content: Ongoing negative self-perception, hopelessness, and self-criticism.\n- Sleep: Poor, with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep; inconsistent sleep schedule.\n- Energy: Low, with significant fatigue and lack of motivation.\n- Social: Minimal engagement outside of work; limited social support.\n- Medication adherence: Good; no current side effects reported.\n- No evidence of psychosis, mania, or active suicidal ideation during session.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella continues to experience symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including persistent low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, sleep disturbance, negative self-evaluation, and social withdrawal. There is some mild improvement in anxiety symptoms since starting sertraline, but core depressive symptoms remain prominent. No acute safety concerns identified at this time. Gabriella demonstrates insight and willingness to engage in therapeutic strategies, though motivation remains low. She is adherent to her medication regimen and open to behavioral interventions, such as thought monitoring and music as self-care.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Medication:** Continue sertraline 50 mg daily in the morning with breakfast. Monitor for efficacy and side effects. Gabriella to report any new or worsening symptoms.\n2. **Therapeutic Interventions:**  \n   - Gabriella will try to jot down negative thoughts as they occur, using a simple note on her phone or paper, to increase awareness and begin to identify patterns.\n   - She will also try listening to music, particularly during walks outside, as a small act of self-care and mood management.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Encourage efforts to establish a more consistent sleep routine and limit late-night phone use, though no specific goals set at this time.\n4. **Social Support:** Continue to explore ways to increase social connection at a manageable pace; validate her concerns about reaching out and reinforce the value of small steps.\n5. **Follow-up:** Schedule next session in one week to review progress with thought monitoring, music as self-care, and overall mood/sleep. Reassess medication response and side effects.\n6. **Safety:** Gabriella to contact clinician or GP if she experiences any worsening of mood, new side effects, or thoughts of self-harm.\n\nGabriella is encouraged to continue with these small steps and to recognize that progress may be gradual. Support and validation provided for her ongoing efforts.",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "That sounds really hard. Does that numb feeling last all day, or do you notice it more at certain times?",

          "clinician": "You mentioned last time you were going to try jotting down some of your negative thoughts as they come up. Were you able to try that at all this week?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I wrote some things on my phone… Mostly just stuff like ‘I’m useless’ or ‘I’m letting everyone down.’ I didn’t really know what else to put besides the same things over and over."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Thank you for doing that, Gabriella. Even just noticing and writing those thoughts is a good start. When you look back at them now, do any patterns stand out to you?",
          "patient": "I guess it’s pretty much always about not being good enough, or like I’m failing at everything. It’s all pretty similar, I think."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That makes sense. Sometimes our minds get stuck on particular themes, like not being good enough. How did it feel to see those thoughts written out?",
          "patient": "Kind of depressing, honestly. But sometimes seeing it, I guess, makes it clear that my brain just keeps repeating the same stuff."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s really insightful—that noticing helps you see it’s a pattern, not necessarily the whole truth. Did you ever try questioning the thought, like asking yourself where the proof is?",
          "patient": "I tried. Sometimes I’d be like, ‘is it true I’m useless?’ But then I just start listing all the stuff I’ve messed up. I can’t think of any reasons why it isn’t true."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a common experience. When we’re depressed, our brains are really good at focusing only on the negative. Are there any small exceptions—even one small thing you did okay this week, even if it felt minor?",
          "patient": "Umm. I guess I made dinner for my mom one night. It was nothing special, just rice and eggs, but she seemed happy."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That actually sounds like a meaningful thing. How did you feel when you saw your mom’s reaction?",
          "patient": "I felt a little better for a bit, I guess, because she smiled and said thank you. But then I thought, it’s just making dinner, that’s nothing."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It might seem like nothing, but for your mom it clearly mattered. Sometimes, the small acts we do have more impact than we give ourselves credit for. Would it be okay if we try to count those as real evidence against the thought ‘I do nothing right’?",
          "patient": "I guess so. It still feels weird to say I did something good, but I see what you mean."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "You’re not alone in that—it’s hard to accept positive evidence when negative thoughts feel so strong. Tell me, did you get a chance to listen to music again this week?",
          "patient": "Yeah, a little. I listened to some old playlists when I was walking. It was okay, like, it helped me not think so much for a bit."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s great. Even music helping a little is a step forward. Did you manage to take any walks, or was that tough this week?",
          "patient": "I went for a couple of walks around the block. Sometimes it’s hard to get going, but I did it, even if they were short."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s an accomplishment, Gabriella. A short walk is still movement, and it’s a positive behavior. What do you notice about your mood or energy after a walk, if anything?",
          "patient": "Maybe just a tiny bit lighter, but it doesn’t last very long. Mostly I’m still tired."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It’s completely normal for mood improvements to be very small at first. It’s still worth noticing those tiny shifts—even if they don’t last long, they’re there. Were there any situations this week that felt especially hard?",
          "patient": "I had an argument with my mom. She was asking if I’d applied to any jobs or reached out to the university. I just felt overwhelmed and then she got frustrated. Then I just went to my room."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "I’m sorry to hear that. Arguments with family can be really draining. What did the argument leave you thinking or feeling afterward?",
          "patient": "Just that I’m a disappointment. I know she’s just trying to help, but I feel like I can’t do what she wants, so I just let her down again."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It sounds like you have high expectations for yourself, and you’re very sensitive to not wanting to let your mom down. Do you ever share with her that you’re finding things tough, or is it hard to talk to her about it?",
          "patient": "It’s hard. She already worries about me. If I tell her I’m struggling, I feel like it just makes things worse for her."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s understandable—you’re trying to protect her. But I wonder, what do you think your mom would want most for you, deep down?",
          "patient": "Probably just to see me happy. Or at least not so sad all the time. I know she cares, I just… I don’t want to make it worse for her by talking about how bad I feel."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It’s a lot to carry on your own. At the same time, staying silent can sometimes add to the feeling of being isolated. Do you think there’s any way you could share a little, or is that too difficult right now?",
          "patient": "Maybe I could try. I don’t know what I’d say though. Just ‘I’m tired’ or ‘I’m having a hard time’?"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a start—sometimes just being honest in a simple way can help open up conversation. You don’t have to have all the answers. Would you feel comfortable trying that this week, even in a small way?",
          "patient": "I could try. I’ll see how it feels."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Thank you for considering that. It’s important to remember you deserve support too, not just your mom. Have you had any more shifts at the restaurant since we last talked?",
          "patient": "I did one shift this week. It was okay. I messed up one order but no one seemed mad. Still felt awkward, but I got through it."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It’s totally normal to make mistakes, especially if you’re not working there regularly. Did anything go a little better, or was it mostly difficult?",
          "patient": "I think I was a little less nervous as the shift went on. One customer actually said thank you and smiled, and that felt okay for a second."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s really significant, even if it was brief. It shows you can interact with people and sometimes get a neutral or positive response. Do you notice how quickly your mind moves past those moments versus when something goes wrong?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I kind of forget the good stuff right away, but the mistakes stick with me."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s something that happens for a lot of us, especially with depression. Our minds are like Velcro for the negative and Teflon for the positive. Part of our work together will be slowly helping you hold onto those positive moments, just a bit longer. What do you think about that?",
          "patient": "I’d like that. I’m just not sure how to do it, but I want to try."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s a great attitude. Maybe this week, when something even a little positive happens—someone smiles, your mom says thank you—you could jot it down, just like you did with the negative thoughts. It doesn’t have to be big or special, just evidence that not everything is bad. How would that feel?",

          "clinician": "That’s all I’m asking, just to notice if anything small feels neutral or good, and note it. Shifting our attention even a little can help change those patterns over time. How has your sleep been this past week? Any change?",

        },

          "clinician": "Do you notice any patterns about when sleep is better or worse—like what you’ve done that day, or how anxious or down you were?",

        {
          "clinician": "Those are important patterns to notice. Maybe, if you notice on a good night what you did differently, over time we can try to repeat those behaviors. How’s your appetite been—any change?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "That’s good to hear. Consistency is really helpful. Have you had any moments, even small, where you felt a little hope, or that things might get better eventually?",

          "clinician": "That’s such a normal worry. Sometimes, all it takes is a short, honest message like, ‘Hey, sorry I haven’t been in touch, things have just been a bit tough. How are you?’ How does that idea feel?",
          "patient": "Scary, but maybe possible. It sounds simple, I just get stuck overthinking it."
        },

          "clinician": "Would you be open to maybe trying it this week—just sending one short message, without worrying about saying everything perfectly?",

Maybe try a simple message to a friend, and keep up music and short walks as you can. How does that plan feel?",

          "clinician": "Thank you, Gabriella. The fact that you’re trying, even when tired and numb, shows a lot of strength. Remember, small steps do add up, even when you can’t feel it right away. Is there anything else you’d like to talk about before we finish today?",

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nGabriella returns for follow-up, reporting that her mood remains largely unchanged since the last session. She describes persistent feelings of emotional numbness and fatigue, stating, “I just do what I have to but I don’t feel much—happy, sad, anything.” The numbness is present most of the day, especially when she is not distracted by work or other activities. She has been able to track negative thoughts as previously discussed, noting recurring themes of self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy (“I’m useless,” “I’m letting everyone down”). Gabriella finds this exercise somewhat depressing but acknowledges it helps her recognize the repetitive nature of these thoughts. She struggles to identify positive evidence to counteract negative beliefs, though she did note making dinner for her mother and receiving a positive response, which briefly improved her mood. \n\nGabriella reports some engagement in pleasurable activities, such as listening to music and taking short walks, which provide minor, temporary relief. She continues to experience significant self-doubt and guilt, particularly after a recent argument with her mother regarding job and university applications. She feels unable to communicate her struggles to her mother for fear of causing additional worry. Social withdrawal persists; she has not contacted friends or returned to campus, expressing feelings of being “stuck” and left behind compared to her peers. Sleep remains disturbed, with difficulty falling and staying asleep, and she notes increased late-night snacking. She denies any new or ongoing side effects from her medication (Sertraline 50 mg daily), stating she is taking it consistently with breakfast. No suicidal ideation or self-harm was reported during the session.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Affect: Blunted, congruent with reported mood.\n- Speech: Normal rate and tone, somewhat subdued.\n- Thought process: Logical, though preoccupied with negative self-appraisal.\n- Thought content: Persistent negative automatic thoughts, low self-esteem, no psychosis or suicidal ideation.\n- Behavior: Engaged in session, able to reflect on experiences and participate in cognitive exercises.\n- Functioning: Maintains some work shifts and basic self-care; continues to isolate socially.\n- Medication adherence: Reports taking Sertraline 50 mg daily with breakfast, no current side effects.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella continues to experience symptoms consistent with Major Depressive Disorder, moderate severity. She reports persistent anhedonia, low energy, negative self-perception, social withdrawal, and sleep disturbance. There is some engagement in behavioral activation (music, walks, work shifts), but positive affect is fleeting and overshadowed by entrenched negative cognitions. She is able to identify and record negative thoughts, though struggles to recognize or internalize positive experiences. No evidence of psychosis, mania, or acute risk. Medication adherence is good, and initial side effects have resolved. Psychosocial stressors include family conflict and academic/career pressures.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Medication:** Continue Sertraline 50 mg daily in the morning with breakfast. Monitor for efficacy and side effects.\n2. **Therapeutic Interventions:**\n   - Continue cognitive restructuring: Encourage Gabriella to not only record negative thoughts but also to actively note any positive or neutral experiences, no matter how small.\n   - Behavioral activation: Maintain engagement in pleasurable activities (music, walks) and work shifts as tolerated.\n   - Social connection: Support Gabriella in attempting brief, low-pressure communication with friends (e.g., a simple message), as she feels able.\n   - Family communication: Explore ways to share her struggles with her mother in a manageable way, starting with simple statements about her mood.\n3. **Sleep hygiene:** Reinforce strategies to improve sleep, such as limiting phone use before bed and increasing physical activity when possible.\n4. **Follow-up:** Reassess mood, sleep, social engagement, and medication response at next session. Continue to monitor for any emergence of suicidal ideation or significant functional decline.\n5. **Support:** Validate Gabriella’s efforts and persistence despite ongoing symptoms. Emphasize the importance of small steps and gradual progress.\n\nGabriella is agreeable to the plan and will attempt to implement the suggested strategies over the coming week. She will return for follow-up as scheduled.",
