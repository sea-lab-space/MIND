    {
      "feature_name": "hometime",
      "rank": 7,
      "explanation": "Time spent at home is a highly informative feature for mental health assessment. Increased hometime can be associated with social withdrawal, depression, or anxiety, while decreased hometime may indicate increased social or occupational engagement. Changes in this metric over time can signal shifts in mental health status."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "disttravelled",
      "rank": 6,
      "explanation": "Total distance traveled reflects overall activity and mobility. Reduced mobility is often seen in depression or during periods of low motivation, while increased mobility may be associated with mania or improved mood. This feature helps clinicians monitor behavioral activation."

      "feature_name": "rog",
      "rank": 6,
      "explanation": "Radius of Gyration quantifies the spatial extent of a person's daily movements. A low value may indicate restricted movement (potentially due to depression or anxiety), while a high value suggests broader engagement with the environment. Useful for detecting changes in routine or isolation."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "maxdiam",
      "rank": 5,
      "explanation": "Maximum diameter between pauses gives a sense of the largest distance covered in a day. It can help identify outlier days or significant events (e.g., travel, avoidance behaviors). Less informative than overall patterns but still useful contextually."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "maxhomedist",
      "rank": 5,
      "explanation": "Maximum distance from home can indicate willingness or ability to venture out. Sudden decreases may signal agoraphobia or depressive symptoms, while increases may reflect improved functioning or manic episodes."

    {
      "feature_name": "probpause",
      "rank": 5,
      "explanation": "Fraction of the day spent paused (stationary) is a good indicator of activity level. High values may indicate inactivity or withdrawal, while low values suggest engagement. Useful for monitoring behavioral activation."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "siglocentropy",
      "rank": 6,
      "explanation": "Entropy of time spent at significant locations reflects routine diversity. Low entropy suggests rigid routines (potentially depressive or anxious states), while high entropy indicates varied engagement. Useful for detecting behavioral changes."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "circdnrtn",
      "rank": 7,
      "explanation": "Circadian routine regularity is highly relevant for mental health. Disrupted routines are common in mood and anxiety disorders. This feature helps clinicians monitor sleep/wake and activity regularity, which are key in many conditions."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "wkenddayrtn",
      "rank": 6,
      "explanation": "Comparing circadian routines on weekdays vs. weekends can reveal work-life balance, social engagement, or disruptions. Changes may indicate stress, burnout, or mood changes."

    {
      "feature_name": "locationvariance",
      "rank": 4,
      "explanation": "Variance in location provides a sense of movement spread. While related to other mobility features, it is less directly interpretable but can support overall assessment."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "loglocationvariance",
      "rank": 3,
