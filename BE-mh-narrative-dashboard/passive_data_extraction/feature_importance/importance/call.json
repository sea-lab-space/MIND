    {
      "feature_name": "count",
      "rank": 7,
      "explanation": "The number of calls (incoming/outgoing) in a given time segment is highly relevant to mental health assessment. Changes in call frequency can indicate shifts in social engagement, isolation, or distress. For example, a sudden drop in outgoing calls may suggest withdrawal, while an increase could indicate seeking support or agitation."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "distinctcontacts",
      "rank": 7,
      "explanation": "The number of distinct contacts reflects the breadth of a person's social network. A reduction in unique contacts may signal social withdrawal or loss of support, which are important markers for depression or other mental health concerns. Conversely, a healthy number of contacts suggests maintained social connections."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "meanduration",
      "rank": 6,
      "explanation": "The mean duration of calls provides insight into the quality of social interactions. Shorter average call durations may indicate superficial or obligatory communication, while longer calls may reflect deeper engagement or support-seeking behavior."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "sumduration",
      "rank": 6,
      "explanation": "The total time spent on calls combines frequency and duration, offering a comprehensive view of social activity. A significant decrease or increase in total call time can be a red flag for changes in mental health status."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "minduration",
      "rank": 3,
      "explanation": "The shortest call duration is less informative on its own, as brief calls can occur for many benign reasons (e.g., missed calls, wrong numbers). It may only be useful in context with other features."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "maxduration",
      "rank": 5,
      "explanation": "The longest call duration can be meaningful, especially if there are outliers (e.g., a very long call during a crisis). It may indicate periods of intense support-seeking or distress."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "stdduration",
      "rank": 4,
      "explanation": "The standard deviation of call durations reflects variability in communication patterns. High variability may suggest instability in social interactions, which can be relevant for certain mental health conditions."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "modeduration",
      "rank": 2,
      "explanation": "The most common call duration is generally less informative for mental health assessment, as it may not capture meaningful changes or outliers in behavior."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "entropyduration",
      "rank": 5,
      "explanation": "Entropy of call durations measures the unpredictability or diversity of call lengths. High entropy may indicate irregular social behavior, which can be a sign of mental health changes."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "timefirstcall",
      "rank": 6,
      "explanation": "The timing of the first call can reflect changes in daily routine or sleep patterns, which are important in mental health assessment. For example, much later first calls may indicate sleep disturbances or lack of motivation."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "timelastcall",
      "rank": 6,
      "explanation": "The timing of the last call is similarly important, as late-night calls may indicate insomnia, distress, or crisis situations. Changes in this pattern can be clinically significant."
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "countmostfrequentcontact",
      "rank": 5,
      "explanation": "The number of calls to the most frequent contact can indicate reliance on a particular support person or, conversely, over-dependence, which may be relevant in certain mental health contexts."
