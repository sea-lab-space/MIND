| **Feature Name** | **Unit** | **Description** |
| `countscans` | scans | Number of scans (rows) from the devices sensed during a time segment instance. The more scans a bluetooth device has the longer it remained within range of the participant’s phone. |
| `uniquedevices` | devices | Number of unique bluetooth devices sensed during a time segment instance as identified by their hardware addresses. |
| `meanscans` | scans | Mean of the scans of every sensed device within each time segment instance. |
| `stdscans` | scans | Standard deviation of the scans of every sensed device within each time segment instance. |
| `countscansmostfrequentdevicewithinsegments` | scans | Number of scans of the most sensed device within each time segment instance. |
| `countscansleastfrequentdevicewithinsegments` | scans | Number of scans of the least sensed device within each time segment instance. |
| `countscansmostfrequentdeviceacrosssegments` | scans | Number of scans of the most sensed device across time segment instances of the same type. |
| `countscansleastfrequentdeviceacrosssegments` | scans | Number of scans of the least sensed device across time segment instances of the same type per device. |
| `countscansmostfrequentdeviceacrossdataset` | scans | Number of scans of the most sensed device across the entire dataset of every participant. |
| `countscansleastfrequentdeviceacrossdataset` | scans | Number of scans of the least sensed device across the entire dataset of every participant. |
