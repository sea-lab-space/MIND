Psychosocial stressors include academic pressures, financial constraints, and some social isolation, which may be contributing to her ongoing symptoms. No evidence of psychosis, mania, or substance use.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. Continue sertraline 50 mg daily; monitor for efficacy and side effects.  \n2. Encourage ongoing participation in counseling; assist Lucy in accessing more frequent sessions if possible (provide referral to university counseling center for additional support).  \n3. Discussed importance of sleep hygiene and stress management techniques; provided handout with resources for mindfulness and campus support groups.  \n4. Encourage regular physical activity and social engagement with friends and family to reduce isolation.  \n5. Safety plan reviewed; Lucy denies suicidal ideation and is aware of resources should this change.  \n6. Schedule follow-up in 4 weeks, or sooner if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise.  \n7. Advised Lucy to contact clinic or crisis services if she experiences any suicidal thoughts, significant mood changes, or medication side effects."

I kind of find it hard to get motivated for things I want to be. I really want to be better, but it's just kind of reaching the end now where I just, I want to do something about it."

Okay, so you don't live far from the uni, but you say you feel like you live with your friends, but you don't feel like you can talk to them.",
          "patient": "Yeah, I mean, they're lovely, I get on really well with them. I don't know, I recently, whenever they want to go out with stuff, I just, I don't want to bring them down. I can't, they don't understand what I'm going through. They kind of, I don't know, they don't make fun of how I feel, but they don't really understand what it's like. I don't want to go out with them and bring them down or stuff."

          "patient": "I guess it kind of started when I was actually, when I was revising for my exams. I guess the stress. I'm a lot of stress on myself. I think I've always wanted to do well for me and I guess for my parents. So the stress of exams and it was also kind of hard because my parents were going through a bit of a troubled time then."

          "clinician": "So around that time for about six months, and it sounds like a lot was happening. So you had a lot of uni pressure on and you said that your parents were having marital problems. Okay, and it sounds like that was a real shock to you.",
          "patient": "Yeah, I guess it was hard as well because I wasn't doing well at uni. I guess I just felt a bit guilty. I know it sounds silly, but I felt like maybe if I could do better, then they would get better, but it just wasn't really happening."

          "clinician": "Okay, that's an awful lot of pressure to put on yourself. I suppose it's just annoying because I know I should have done better and I just didn't, and I guess I beat myself up a lot about.",

        },

It would be understandable, absolutely, that you wouldn't do as well as normal. I suppose. I'm just wondering if you have very high standards for yourself.",
          "patient": "Probably, maybe more than other people. My parents have always kind of taught me, not in a loving way, I guess, but you should do your best, but also get the best. And I agree with it. I think that's the right thing to think. But when I don't do that, I don't know, it annoys me a lot, and I worry that it annoys them."

          "patient": "I think it, it doesn't sound good. I don't really talk to them a lot, but I don't think they're going through very good. I don't like to talk to them about it because it just makes me feel worse, but I don't think it's getting any better."

You've been feeling very low, you've had uni pressure on, you've had problems with your parents' marriage, and sounds like you feel like you can't really reach out to anyone, that you can't understand, but you can't really reach out to your parents right now. You can't really confide in your friends. So I suppose I'm just wondering if you can tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling. I mean, say this past week.",
          "patient": "Really not good, to be honest, actually. If I don't have to, then I don't really leave the house or get out of bed. I just, I can't find the motivation for the things that I used to enjoy. I used to love doing sports or going out, and now I just prefer to lie in bed, not really do anything. I missed a few lectures this week that I should have gone to."

          "patient": "I don't really see the point anymore. If I can't do as well as I should be doing, then what's the point in putting myself in those positions? I can't be bothered anymore to try. It just stresses me out more than I need to."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so it sounds like the kind of thoughts you've got on your head are, it's pointless, it's not worth it. Do you have any other thoughts in your head when you're just at that point before you go to the lecture?",
          "patient": "Like I said, no, I don't really even deserve to be here. If I can't do well enough. I see all these other students are doing well and doing better and want to be there. I don't know why I'm here, even at uni, to be honest."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So it sounds like you feel like you're not as good as other people here. Is it okay if I take notes as we go through? It's just I'm trying to, I guess, understand what you're telling me and it helps me just to write it down. And I'll share this with you later. Okay, so it sounds like those are some quite negative thoughts to have. You're kind of saying, you know, it feels like it's pointless, it's more effort than it's worth, and I don't deserve to be here. I mean, when you have those thoughts, how do you feel?",
          "patient": "Very unworthy, probably would be the best way to put it. Kind of, I don't know. Lower than normal. Because then it makes me think about all the things that I should have been doing better."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so what you described there, then you said I'm unworthy. I should be doing lots of things better. Those are kind of what I would, I would call thoughts, actually. I suppose I'm trying to understand what it feels like in your gut. What kind of emotions? Do you feel happier or do you feel sad? Do? What kind of emotions are you feeling when you have those thoughts?",
          "patient": "Sad, not happiness, no. Sad, bit of kind of anger and frustration as well."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "I know just when you're kind of telling me this, and I know this is quite a heavy topic, but you're kind of laughing. And I suppose I wonder a little bit, you're a bit, you know, how do you feel about having these emotions, talking about these emotions?",
          "patient": "Embarrassed. I've never yet to talk about it, so it's quite uncomfortable for me, that you."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Well, you're doing a great job because I know, I know that this can be difficult. Okay, so it sounds like some of the thoughts you're describing are it's pointless, it's more than it's worth, I don't deserve to be here, I'm unworthy. And those kind of thoughts, it sounds like they just flip through your mind and then you kind of describing different emotions that those lead to, you kind of scrambling, sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed. What about in your body? What happens, how you feel kind of physically?",
          "patient": "I used to be, I think, from those emotions, very wound up, very kind of stressed all the time. But recently it's just been a lot more draining than anything, just quite lethargic and can't be bothered anymore. And my body reflects that. But then when I try and sleep, I just can't seem to have a satisfied night's sleep. It's really, really frustrating."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So it sounds like this is affecting you, it's draining you of your energy, like your body can't be bothered. I think that's a really good way of describing it. And you're noticing sleep problems as well. And then what do you do? So this is, so we're back to the point before the lecture. So you start having these thoughts, these emotions, and you know, your body, I guess it sounds like those thoughts are quite draining, so they're draining your energy. What then happens? What do you do next?",
          "patient": "I kind of focus on the negative thoughts and I probably should not think about them, but I focus on them. And then I don't really want to do anything. I just stay in bed."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Or so you think even more about those kind of worries that you have? So you do a bit of dwelling and you stay in bed. And it sounds like you don't, you haven't tried speaking to your friends about it?",
          "patient": "No."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Or speaking to the family, okay? And then after you've done that, so after you've not gone to the lecture, you've stayed in bed, you've spent time, as you said, focusing on those thoughts, those negative thoughts. How do you feel after that? Do you feel better or do you feel worse?",
          "patient": "I guess I feel slightly worse, but then a bit numb in a way. Kind of once you've felt that, because I do feel tired all the time, I just try and push it out, and then you don't really think about anything. And it's almost nicer that way than to keep focusing on how much you're getting wrong and how much you can't do stuff. Sometimes it's better just not to think about it at all."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So it sounds like in some ways, it's a bit of a relief to do that, but in other ways, maybe you think it might make things worse.",

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nLucy is a university student referred by her GP due to persistent low mood and lack of motivation. She reports feeling \"quite bad\" for several months, with symptoms worsening over the past few months. Lucy describes a progressive decline in mood, starting with feeling \"a bit low\" and \"wound up,\" escalating to significant anhedonia and difficulty motivating herself for daily activities. She expresses a strong desire to improve but feels unable to do so. Lucy reports social isolation, stating she has no one to talk to about her feelings, and feels misunderstood by friends and family. She lives with friends but avoids socializing to prevent \"bringing them down\" and feels unable to confide in them. Academic stress and her parents' marital problems have contributed to her distress, with her mood decline coinciding with exam periods and family difficulties. Lucy expresses guilt over her academic performance and internalizes responsibility for her parents' issues. She holds herself to high standards and feels frustrated and unworthy when she does not meet them. Over the past week, Lucy reports marked anhedonia, low energy, and poor motivation, often staying in bed and missing lectures. She experiences pervasive negative thoughts, including feelings of pointlessness, unworthiness, and not deserving her place at university. She describes sadness, anger, frustration, embarrassment, and physical lethargy. Sleep is disturbed, with difficulty achieving restful sleep. She tends to ruminate on negative thoughts, leading to further withdrawal and emotional numbness. Lucy denies having anyone to talk to and has not discussed her feelings with friends or family.\n\n**Objective:**  \nLucy presents as a young adult female, alert and oriented, with a flat affect and low energy. She appears withdrawn and reluctant to discuss her emotions, expressing embarrassment about her difficulties. Speech is coherent but subdued. She reports significant social withdrawal, poor motivation, and missed academic obligations. No evidence of psychosis, mania, or overt suicidal ideation was elicited during the interview. Sleep disturbance and anhedonia are prominent. No physical health concerns were reported. She is currently prescribed Sertraline 50 mg once daily, initiated by her GP.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nLucy is experiencing a moderate to severe depressive episode, characterized by persistent low mood, anhedonia, social withdrawal, low self-worth, guilt, poor motivation, and sleep disturbance. Her symptoms have been ongoing for at least six months, with recent worsening. Academic and family stressors are significant contributing factors. She demonstrates maladaptive perfectionism and internalized guilt, with negative automatic thoughts and ruminative patterns. There is no current evidence of psychosis or acute risk, but her level of functional impairment is high, and she is at risk for further deterioration if not adequately supported. She is currently taking Sertraline 50 mg daily, which may require monitoring and possible adjustment.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Continue Sertraline 50 mg once daily; monitor for efficacy and side effects.\n- Schedule follow-up in 2-4 weeks to assess response to medication and overall progress.\n- Recommend referral for psychological therapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) to address negative thought patterns, perfectionism, and coping strategies.\n- Encourage gradual re-engagement with academic and social activities as tolerated.\n- Provide psychoeducation regarding depression, the role of stress, and the importance of self-care.\n- Assess risk of self-harm or suicidal ideation at each visit; provide crisis resources as needed.\n- Encourage Lucy to consider identifying a trusted individual (friend, university counselor) for additional support.\n- Liaise with university support services to explore academic accommodations if needed.\n- Monitor sleep and consider adjunctive interventions if sleep disturbance persists.\n- Review medication adherence and side effects at next appointment.",

          "clinician": "That\u2019s totally understandable. Sometimes starting small can make a difference. We can explore thought-challenging exercises\u2014like noting down negative thoughts and then questioning them. Would you be open to trying to write some of those thoughts out, even if just to bring them here next time?",
          "patient": "I can try. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be good at it, but I\u2019ll give it a go."

          "clinician": "There\u2019s no perfect way to do it\u2014it\u2019s just about catching the thoughts as they come. I\u2019d also encourage you to try a very small activity, even going out for a five-minute walk, and noting how you feel after. Do you think this is something you could try?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I\u2019ll try. Five minutes seems doable. I guess there\u2019s no harm just seeing what happens."

          "patient": "It's hard but a little better than last time. I guess I just wish I wasn\u2019t dragging these feelings around everywhere. But it helps to say it out loud."

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nLucy reports that her mood has been \"mixed\" since the last session, with some days feeling slightly easier, particularly when distracted by friends or brief outings. However, she continues to struggle with low motivation, persistent feelings of disconnection, and loneliness. She has not disclosed her feelings to friends or family, fearing she would bring down their mood or not be understood. Lucy describes ongoing negative self-comparisons, especially related to university performance and social interactions, which often lead her to withdraw and spend extended periods alone, typically scrolling on her phone. She identifies university-related activities and communication from parents or classmates as triggers for intensified negative thoughts. \n\nLucy continues to experience disrupted sleep, characterized by difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and occasional all-nighters, resulting in persistent fatigue. Her appetite remains low, with irregular eating patterns and occasional snacking. She acknowledges ongoing thoughts of unworthiness and numbness, including passive thoughts about not caring if she were present or not, but denies any active suicidal intent or plans. She expresses willingness to reach out to her GP if her safety becomes a concern and is open to developing a safety plan that includes her GP and crisis line contacts, but prefers not to involve family or housemates at this time.\n\nAcademically, Lucy is significantly behind in her coursework, missing lectures and struggling to catch up, which increases her anxiety about failing. She has not yet reached out to university support services due to fear of judgment but is open to assistance in drafting communication. At work, she has reduced her hours and feels less engaged, attributing this to fatigue from university stress. Financially, she is managing with her scholarship and job, but is anxious about the potential consequences of academic or occupational setbacks.\n\nLucy reports adherence to her sertraline regimen, taking it every morning as prescribed. She notes minimal side effects (mild initial nausea, now resolved) and has not observed significant improvement in mood yet. She expresses interest in learning techniques to manage negative thoughts and increase motivation, though she finds it difficult to sustain self-help efforts. She is willing to try thought-challenging exercises and brief daily activities, such as short walks, as discussed in session.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Affect: Flat, with periods of tearfulness and expressed hopelessness.\n- Speech: Normal rate and tone, coherent.\n- Thought process: Logical, though preoccupied with negative self-appraisal and hopelessness.\n- No evidence of psychosis or mania.\n- Denies active suicidal ideation, intent, or plan.\n- Sleep: Disrupted, with insomnia and non-restorative sleep.\n- Appetite: Decreased, with irregular eating.\n- Function: Impaired academic and occupational performance; social withdrawal.\n- Medication adherence: Reports taking sertraline daily as prescribed; no significant side effects currently.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nLucy continues to experience symptoms consistent with moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder, including persistent low mood, anhedonia, social withdrawal, sleep and appetite disturbances, low energy, impaired concentration, and passive thoughts of worthlessness. She is at risk for further functional decline academically and occupationally. Protective factors include insight, willingness to engage in treatment, and openness to safety planning. She is adherent to sertraline, with minimal side effects, but has not yet experienced significant therapeutic benefit. No current active suicidal ideation or intent, but ongoing monitoring is warranted given her passive thoughts and functional impairment.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Medication:** Continue sertraline as prescribed (likely 50mg daily in the morning). Monitor for efficacy and side effects. Consider dose adjustment if no improvement in symptoms after an adequate trial period.\n2. **Safety:** Develop a personalized safety plan including GP and crisis line contacts; provide information on text/online support resources. Encourage Lucy to reach out if her safety becomes a concern.\n3. **Psychosocial Interventions:**  \n   - Introduce thought-challenging exercises; encourage Lucy to record negative thoughts and bring them to the next session.\n   - Encourage engagement in small, manageable activities (e.g., five-minute daily walks) and track mood changes.\n   - Assist Lucy in drafting an email to university support/tutors to address academic concerns.\n4. **Support:** Provide crisis line and student support contact information. Reinforce the importance of self-compassion and gradual progress.\n5. **Follow-up:** Schedule next session for one week. Encourage Lucy to reach out between sessions if needed. Continue to monitor mood, safety, medication adherence, and functional status. \n\n**Patient verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan.**",

        {
          "clinician": "That\u2019s completely understandable, Lucy. Even one ten-minute walk is a really good start, especially when things feel so challenging. What did you notice\u2014if anything\u2014after that walk?",
          "patient": "Honestly? I felt a little less heavy for a bit. I mean, I still went back to bed after, but for like, half an hour it just felt slightly less bad."

          "clinician": "That\u2019s valuable\u2014it might not feel like much, but any change in how you\u2019re feeling, even temporarily, can be important to notice. Did anything in particular make it hard to try again the following days?",
          "patient": "I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I was tired, and it felt like it wouldn\u2019t change anything anyway. And then when I didn\u2019t do it, I just felt like I failed at that too."

          "patient": "I just kept thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the point?\u2019 Or, \u2018Other people can do this easily, and I can\u2019t even manage a walk.\u2019 Kind of that same stuff from before."

          "patient": "I tried a couple times, but then I looked at it and just thought it was silly. Like, why am I writing down all these negative things\u2014it just made me feel worse reading it back."
        },

          "clinician": "That\u2019s a very understandable reaction. Sometimes the first few attempts at noticing or writing our thoughts are uncomfortable because we become more aware of the negativity. Would you like to talk through one of those thoughts here\u2014perhaps together, we can try to look at it from a different angle?",
          "patient": "I guess so. The one that comes up the most is, \u2018I\u2019m not good enough.\u2019 That\u2019s what I wrote down."

          "patient": "Usually it\u2019s like, I\u2019m not good enough at uni, not good enough as a friend, or even as a daughter. Like I keep messing everything up."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It sounds like those feelings stretch across many areas of your life. If we were to gently question that thought, is there any evidence\u2014even a small example\u2014that might go against the idea that you aren\u2019t good enough?",
          "patient": "I guess I keep showing up to work. Even when I\u2019m feeling awful, I\u2019m still managing to do that. And I do try\u2014I keep coming here. But it just feels like the bare minimum sometimes."

Could we include those as evidence that maybe you\u2019re more resilient and capable than you feel sometimes?",

          "clinician": "That makes sense\u2014logic and feelings can be at odds, but you\u2019re open to considering it. If you were speaking to a friend who felt the same way, would you judge them for struggling or see them as not good enough?",
          "patient": "No, definitely not. I\u2019d probably just tell them they\u2019re doing the best they can. But I can never think of myself the same way."
        },

          "clinician": "That\u2019s a very common pattern. We\u2019re often much kinder to others than ourselves. Would you be open to practicing self-compassion\u2014maybe just noticing when you\u2019re being hard on yourself, and imagining what you\u2019d say to a friend in the same situation?",
          "patient": "Yeah\u2026 I can try. I don\u2019t know if it will work but I can try to do that."

          "patient": "Sleep is still not great. I have nights where I just lie awake for hours, then I\u2019ll sleep half the next day. Meals\u2014I forget a lot, or I eat snacks instead of real food."

        },
        {
          "clinician": "Feeling guilt about letting others down is really common in depression. But it sounds like your friends care. Do you feel like you could let one of them in a little, even if just to say that things have been hard?",
          "patient": "I don\u2019t know\u2026 I still feel like I\u2019d just end up saying too much or making them worry. I hate seeing people uncomfortable."

          "clinician": "That\u2019s an understandable worry. Sometimes just saying, \u2018I\u2019ve been having a rough time lately\u2019 is enough to let a friend know you\u2019re not okay, without needing to share every detail. Have you thought about sending a message or talking in person if the moment feels right?",

          "patient": "Still behind. I missed another lecture, but I did manage to listen to a recording of one of the past ones. That actually felt like a little win, but I\u2019m still scared about how much I missed."

        {
          "clinician": "That\u2019s a great step\u2014listening to a recording and catching up counts as progress. Did you feel slightly less overwhelmed after doing it, or did you have mixed feelings?",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "It\u2019s very common to feel both encouraged and discouraged during recovery. Would you be willing to break things into even smaller steps? Sometimes focusing on just one lecture or one assignment at a time makes it less overwhelming.",

        },
        {
          "clinician": "That makes sense\u2014long lists can feel paralyzing. What if we started with picking just one small task for each day, even if it\u2019s as simple as opening your class platform or reading a single email from your tutor?",
          "patient": "I could do that. That doesn\u2019t seem as scary as trying to finish everything all at once."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Great\u2014we\u2019ll build from there. Are you still working at the university IT desk a few shifts per week?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I cut back a bit, but I\u2019m still doing two shifts a week. My manager\u2019s been understanding about me being quieter."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That\u2019s good to hear you have some flexibility at work. Do you find having the structure of the job helps at all, or does it add to your stress?",
          "patient": "Both, really. Sometimes the routine helps\u2014I have to get out of bed. But, by the end of the day, I just feel drained. It\u2019s hard to keep smiling at people."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "I understand. Do you feel able to ask for more flexibility if you need it\u2014like swapping shifts or taking a day off, if things feel too much?",
          "patient": "Maybe, but I worry about disappointing them, or losing the job. I need the money for rent, so I just keep going even if I\u2019m exhausted."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "You\u2019re managing a lot of responsibility\u2014work, studies, managing your health. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge how heavy that must feel. Can we look at ways to build in tiny pockets of rest or self-care, even if it\u2019s just five minutes between things?",
          "patient": "Maybe. I never really thought about it, but I could try\u2026 like, just listening to music, or something like that?"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Listening to music is a great example. Even brief moments\u2014stretching, a cup of tea, a short phone call with someone you trust\u2014can help reset your mood. Would it be helpful to brainstorm a short list of things you might do?",
          "patient": "Sure. Could you help me come up with some ideas? Sometimes I can\u2019t think of anything when I\u2019m actually in the moment."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Of course. How about we each suggest a few things and you tell me what sounds doable? For starters: listening to a favorite song, stepping outside for fresh air, writing a quick journal entry, stretching, making a cup of tea, or texting a friend. Which of those feels realistic?",
          "patient": "Music and tea, for sure. Maybe stretching. I\u2019m not sure about journaling, but I can try the others."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "That\u2019s a great list. You can aim to try just one each day or whenever you notice your mood getting lower. Over time, these tiny habits can add up. Coming back to your medication, are you still taking sertraline in the mornings? Any changes or issues?",
          "patient": "Yes, I\u2019m still on it every morning. No new side effects. I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really making much difference though."

          "patient": "I have had a couple days where I just felt really numb again. Not really wanting to do anything. I didn\u2019t really want to hurt myself, I just felt like I didn\u2019t care much either way."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Thank you for being honest. That feeling of numbness is a sign your depression is still very present, but I\u2019m glad to hear you haven\u2019t wanted to act on those feelings. If things were to get worse or you did have urges to hurt yourself, are you still okay to reach out to your GP, crisis lines, or me?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I think so. I haven\u2019t needed to yet, but I\u2019d probably text a support line or call my GP if it got that bad. Part of me still doesn\u2019t want to make a fuss, though."

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nLucy reports that her mood and daily functioning have not changed significantly since the last session. She attempted to implement some behavioral activation strategies discussed previously, such as going for a short walk, but found it difficult to maintain consistency. She describes feeling a transient improvement in mood after walking, but this was short-lived, and she subsequently felt discouraged and self-critical for not continuing. Lucy continues to experience pervasive thoughts of inadequacy, particularly around her academic performance, friendships, and family roles. She attempted to journal her negative thoughts but found the process uncomfortable and unhelpful, as it increased her awareness of negativity. Lucy acknowledges that she is able to maintain some responsibilities, such as attending work and therapy, but minimizes these achievements, viewing them as the \"bare minimum.\" She recognizes a pattern of being more compassionate toward others than herself and is open to practicing self-compassion, though she is unsure if it will help.\n\nLucy reports ongoing sleep disturbances, with difficulty falling asleep and sleeping during the day. Her appetite is poor, often forgetting meals or substituting snacks for proper meals. She feels some guilt when roommates inquire about her well-being but is hesitant to share her struggles for fear of burdening others. She is open to the idea of reaching out to a friend via text and worked with the clinician to draft a message during the session.\n\nAcademically, Lucy remains behind on assignments and lectures but managed to listen to a recorded lecture, which she identified as a small win. She feels overwhelmed by her workload and experiences anxiety when confronted with her to-do list. She is willing to try breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.\n\nLucy continues to work two shifts per week at the university IT desk. She finds the structure helpful at times but also exhausting. She is concerned about asking for further flexibility due to financial needs and fear of disappointing her employer. She is open to incorporating brief self-care activities, such as listening to music or making tea, into her routine.\n\nLucy is currently taking sertraline every morning as prescribed and reports no new side effects. She is unsure if the medication is helping but is willing to continue for now. She describes episodes of emotional numbness and low motivation but denies active suicidal ideation or intent. She is aware of crisis resources and agrees to reach out if her symptoms worsen.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Appearance: Tired, but engaged and cooperative during session.\n- Affect: Restricted, congruent with reported mood.\n- Thought process: Logical, though negative and self-critical content predominates.\n- Insight: Good; recognizes patterns of negative thinking and is open to therapeutic interventions.\n- Sleep: Poor, with insomnia and hypersomnia.\n- Appetite: Decreased, irregular meals.\n- Functioning: Attending work (reduced hours), behind on academic tasks, limited social engagement.\n- Medication adherence: Reports taking sertraline daily, no side effects.\n- Safety: No current suicidal ideation or intent; passive thoughts of numbness and apathy.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nLucy continues to experience symptoms of moderate to severe major depressive disorder, including low mood, anhedonia, sleep and appetite disturbances, low energy, impaired concentration, and pervasive negative self-evaluation. She demonstrates some engagement with behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring strategies but struggles with consistency and self-compassion. Protective factors include ongoing engagement in therapy, adherence to medication, maintenance of some work and academic responsibilities, and willingness to reach out for help if needed. No acute safety concerns at present, but ongoing monitoring is warranted given her reports of numbness and low motivation.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Medication:** Continue sertraline as prescribed (commonly 50 mg once daily in the morning; confirm dosage in chart). Monitor for efficacy and side effects. Reassess in a few weeks; consider medication review with GP/psychiatrist if limited improvement persists.\n2. **Therapy:** Continue weekly sessions focused on behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and self-compassion exercises. Encourage Lucy to notice and challenge negative self-talk and to practice responding to herself as she would to a friend.\n3. **Behavioral Activation:** Support Lucy in identifying and implementing small, manageable daily activities (e.g., listening to music, making tea, brief walks, stretching). Emphasize the value of small steps and celebrate incremental progress.\n4. **Academic Support:** Encourage breaking academic tasks into smaller steps and focusing on one task at a time. Reinforce any progress, however minor.\n5. **Social Support:** Support Lucy in reaching out to a friend via text, using the drafted message. Encourage her to notice the impact of this connection.\n6. **Self-care:** Brainstorm and implement brief self-care activities throughout the day.\n7. **Safety:** Provide crisis line and support contact information. Reinforce plan for reaching out if symptoms worsen or if suicidal ideation emerges.\n8. **Follow-up:** Schedule next session for one week. Email support contacts as discussed. Continue to monitor mood, functioning, and safety.",
