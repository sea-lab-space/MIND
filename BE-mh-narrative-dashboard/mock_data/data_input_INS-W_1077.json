She reports limited support from family and difficulty accessing mental health care that feels culturally sensitive. Alison is currently in a long-term relationship, which she describes as supportive, but she feels isolated due to her busy schedule and lack of time for self-care. She denies current alcohol or illicit drug use. No known allergies. She expresses regret about the overdose and states she does not want to die, but feels \"stuck\" and \"without options.\"\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Vital signs on admission: BP 128/76 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 18, Temp 98.6\u00b0F, SpO2 99% on room air.  \n- General: Alert, oriented x3, appears tearful but cooperative.  \n- HEENT: No jaundice, no scleral icterus.  \n- Abdomen: Mild right upper quadrant tenderness, no rebound or guarding, no hepatomegaly.  \n- Neuro: No focal deficits, normal gait, speech clear.  \n- Skin: No rashes, no track marks, no signs of trauma.  \n- Labs:  \n  - Acetaminophen level (3 hours post-ingestion): 135 mcg/mL  \n  - LFTs: AST 38, ALT 41 (mildly elevated)  \n  - Renal function: WNL  \n  - CBC: WNL  \n  - Coagulation profile: INR 1.1  \n- Urine toxicology: Negative for other substances  \n- Psychiatric evaluation: Mood depressed, affect congruent, insight fair, judgment impaired at time of overdose, denies current suicidal ideation or plan.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAlison Daniels is a 38-year-old woman with a history of psychosocial stressors who presented after intentional self-harm via paracetamol overdose. She is at risk for acute liver injury, though currently only mild transaminitis is noted. Her overdose appears to be a response to chronic stress, depression, and lack of adequate social and mental health support. She is currently medically stable and expresses remorse, with no ongoing suicidal ideation. Social determinants, including financial strain, single parenthood, and cultural barriers to mental health care, are significant contributors to her current crisis.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Medical Management:**  \n   - Initiate N-acetylcysteine (NAC) protocol for acetaminophen toxicity.  \n   - Monitor LFTs, renal function, and coagulation profile every 8 hours for 24-48 hours.  \n   - Supportive care: IV fluids, antiemetics as needed, monitor for signs of hepatic failure.\n\n2. **Psychiatric Care:**  \n   - Continue 1:1 observation for safety while inpatient.  \n   - Arrange for psychiatric consultation and crisis intervention.  \n   - Begin brief supportive counseling; explore coping strategies and safety planning.\n\n3. **Social Support:**  \n   - Consult social work to assess for resources, including financial assistance, childcare support, and culturally sensitive mental health services.  \n   - Provide information on local community mental health centers and support groups for Black women and single mothers.\n\n4. **Discharge Planning:**  \n   - Discharge only after psychiatric clearance and once medically stable.  \n   - Arrange close outpatient follow-up with primary care and mental health providers.  \n   - Encourage involvement of her partner and trusted friends/family in her support network.\n\n5. **Education:**  \n   - Educate Alison on the risks of acetaminophen overdose and the importance of medication safety.  \n   - Discuss warning signs of depression and when to seek help.\n\n6. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Schedule follow-up appointments within 1 week of discharge for both medical and psychiatric care.  \n   - Provide crisis hotline and emergency contact information.\n\nAlison was receptive to the plan and expressed willingness to engage in ongoing care."

          "clinician": "Okay, so what's brought you here today, Alison?",

          "clinician": "Do you want to tell me a bit more about what's been going on?",

        {
          "clinician": "Well, if we start with asking a bit about your mood, how have you been feeling in yourself?",
          "patient": "A bit fed up. At 4 in the morning, everything just seems very black. It's just like swimming and tree cooling in. And I just don't... I think by tea time, by the time the kids get home, I've been able to have a fairly decent conversation with them."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "But, and can I just check, Alison, when you say things feel very black, do you mean you feel very...?",
          "patient": "Miserable."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Miserable, okay. And what about sort of feeling tearful? Has that been happening?",
          "patient": "I dropped my sugar the other day and I just burst into tears."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So is it the slightest thing that would make you feel tearful? Things that perhaps wouldn't ordinarily bother you?",
          "patient": "Yeah, my sister's noticed as well."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Right, okay. So you've been feeling very low and with episodes of tearfulness. What about other things? What about your energy levels? Are you managing to keep up with things?",
          "patient": "I used to do a lot with the kids. I used to playing with them, but now I just spend the day on the sofa, really, have to go to work."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And just remind me, what is it you do for a living? So how have you been managing at work?",
          "patient": "I'm not been going in as much because I just feel so exhausted. But I mean, we're just not... The supermarket's been taken over and they've cut the wages, and problems with the bills, it's like catalogues again, just write me letters. You know, the kids, they want all these new games and stuff. It's just, you know."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Things are really difficult all round. With all this going on, how are you sleeping, Alison?",
          "patient": "It takes me a year to go to sleep. I used to read a book, and drop off. But now I just spend my time looking at the clock, it goes round."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So from actually getting off to bed and getting off to sleep, how long is that taking?",
          "patient": "A couple of hours, probably."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Once you're actually asleep, are you waking up much during the night?",
          "patient": "I wake up about... last night, I think it was about 4 o'clock I caught."
        },
        {

          "patient": "No."

        {
          "clinician": "And then when you're actually getting out of bed in the morning, are you still feeling tired at that point?",
          "patient": "Exhausted. I feel like my brain's not being switched off and just exhausted... to the legs day."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. What about eating? What's your appetite been like while you've been feeling like this?",
          "patient": "I used to have quite a weight problem, but the last couple of months that's just a bit looser, just... know how. No, no, the kids come in from school and they make their own stuff, you know, just don't bother, really."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so your appetite's gone down as well. What about things like concentrating and your memory, both when, I don't know, watching TV at home or out when you're out doing your job?",
          "patient": "Well, it... might be pretty useless with the kids. So I forgot the swimming money last week, PE kit and parents' evening, even, start one job and... like I'm not explaining myself very well, it's like the television, I used to like watching the soaps, EastEnders or something, and 10 minutes later just... you know, I'm thinking of something else."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. And what about things, Alison, that you used to enjoy? Are there things in life that you still enjoy at the moment?",
          "patient": "Nothing really. As I say, a bit useless with the kids, used to enjoy going out. I used to go out with my friends for pictures and things. But of course, now... just can't be bothered. You don't feel like it as well. What's the point, really? You know?"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And I was going to ask, how old are your children now?",
          "patient": "I had a bit late, didn't I? It took a long, long time for me to have them. I've got a girl and a boy, one's 11, one's 9."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And looking after children takes a lot of time and energy. How are you managing to keep up with that, feeling as low as you do?",
          "patient": "Well, they're a bit self-sufficient, really. The kids do, they're from school, get their own tea, I should be doing more for them really, but now I'm just a bit useless at that at the moment."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And what about looking after yourself?",
          "patient": "Well, you can see I'm just a mess. Dave used to say, that's my boyfriend, I used to, you know, not have much money, but I'd take a bit of pride in what I was doing, you know, and my hair and stuff. Back home, can't be bothered with that. Now's no point, really."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And you mentioned Dave, that's your current partner. How long have you and Dave been together?",
          "patient": "About a year, but..."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And how are things, because often when people feel really down, it has a real impact on everything, including their relationships. How are things between you and Dave at the moment?",
          "patient": "Well, he's not ringing as much, there used to be texts, but he's going, you know, he's getting fed up with me not wanting to go out"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "It's a slightly embarrassing thing to ask about, but I guess it's important. Often when people are really feeling very low, it affects everything in their relationship, including things like the sex life. Have you noticed any changes there for you?",
          "patient": "He's always trying to pressure me a little bit. I'm really not into that at the moment."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Just don't feel like that at the moment.",
          "patient": "Yeah"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. So can I just recap, Alison, and check I've got this right? For the last few months, you've been feeling really down, no energy, problems with your sleeping and eating, problems with concentrating, not really enjoying things and actually struggling a bit with the kids and perhaps some difficulties in your relationship with Dave. Have I got that right?",
          "patient": "Yeah"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Can I ask, Alison, in the past, have there ever been episodes when you felt like this?",
          "patient": "When my husband left. I was always crying then, for no particular reason. I haven't told anybody this before, but I took some tablets."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So how long ago were we talking about this? A few years ago?",
          "patient": "About four years. About four years ago."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so you took some tablets. Can you tell me, is it all right? Tell me a little bit more about that.",
          "patient": "What it's like? Kids are in bed. And you're on your own. And had a few glasses of wine, and just took these tablets."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. Do you remember what you actually took at the time, what sort of tablets they were?",
          "patient": "They just did the bathroom cabinet and... paracetamol"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so you took some paracetamol. Can you remember sort of roughly how many you took?",
          "patient": "About almost two strips, about 12."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Right, okay. And you'd had a couple of glasses of wine. Did you take anything else, any other tablets with it? And was this something, Alison, that you'd thought about for a while, or was it something that was quite a sort of spur of the moment decision that evening?",
          "patient": "There are so many crying a lot, but I just... but you know, it's a... of a burden to everybody really."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And was there any other things you did around the time? Sometimes when people take time, because they leave a note or do other kind of final acts, get their affairs in order, did you do any of those things?",
          "patient": "Just took the tablets and go to sleep."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay? So did you have any thoughts about what taking the tablets would do? Did you...?",
          "patient": "I just thought I'd go to sleep and not wake up. But I woke up a couple of hours later and I was really sick everywhere. God."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So, so you actually, if I wanted to check, I get this right? Because at this point, you actually thought they would kill you? At the time.",
          "patient": "I just did one call. I just say I'm just a useless, just a useless mom now. And I was there."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. So you took the tablets, you were very sick in the night. Did you seek any medical help at the time?",
          "patient": "No, no."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. And then you were okay the following day?",
          "patient": "Yeah, just felt a bit of a twit, really."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Did you feel pleased that you were still alive?",
          "patient": "Yeah, I think, you know, I realized it would just be silly."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "So that was a few years ago. So if we just come back to how you're feeling at the moment, you've talked about feeling very low. Have there been times currently when you've thought about either taking an overdose or doing something else to harm yourself in any way?",
          "patient": "You know what, no. When you're watching the clock and you know you're on your own, the kids are in bed, it just... everything's so hard. And yeah, but you know, it just feels easy, you know?"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And has that just been something you've thought about? Have you actually made any plans, got any tablets in or done anything else?",
          "patient": "No."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And I guess it's a difficult question to ask, but one we would ask everybody in your situation. Have things ever been so bad, you've got so low that you've not only thought about harming yourself or perhaps killing yourself, but also wondered whether the best thing might be to take the children with you?",
          "patient": "My kids, they look like kids. no."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay. And what about sort of the other side of that, things, positive things, sort of things to look for, things that you feel good about?",
          "patient": "Not... kids sometimes, you know? They do things that make you think, you know, I don't... what's good about life and things, but..."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "And are there other things that help then? I'm thinking about people who can be supportive.",
          "patient": "My sister, as I say, she said to get down here and she's always there. She comes down, rings, got a couple of friends, they're quite good, but on day one is in the mood, of course, but I don't think he's going to be around for much longer."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Do you think or do you feel able to keep yourself safe at the moment from hurting yourself?",
          "patient": "So yeah. And I know I can come here now, and you've been very good today."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Do you think if that was to change so that you didn't feel you're able to keep yourself safe, you'd be able to let anybody know?",
          "patient": "All I know what happened last time, that was nothing. No, no, no, no, was silly then. So now I'd come here."
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Okay, so, well, thanks for going through all that. I can appreciate it must be very painful. It does sound to me like you are suffering from symptoms that strongly suggest that you're actually depressed at the moment. Now, I'm not sure how much you know about depression.",
          "patient": "Not much really"
        },
        {
          "clinician": "Well, I guess just briefly, depression can cause a number of problems for people. Traditionally, we think about people feeling very low and very miserable and often thinking about hurting themselves, but it can also affect all other areas of life in terms of problems of eating and sleeping. And the other problems you've noticed is that concentration and perhaps not really managing as well as normal. I guess the positive side is that you've done something about it and you've come to talk to me about it today. And I think there are almost certainly a range of things we can put in place to help you and treatments that are available. So I guess what I'm thinking was it might be worth just spending a few minutes just thinking about some of those options for you so that we can start to improve things for you. Would that be all right with you?",
          "patient": "I need to do this. Yes, sounds sensible. Yeah."

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nAlison, a woman in her late 30s to early 40s, presents today at the urging of her sister due to feeling \"fuddled up\" and low for the past few months. She describes persistent low mood, particularly severe in the early morning hours, with feelings of misery and tearfulness triggered by minor events. Alison reports significant anhedonia, stating she no longer enjoys activities she previously liked, such as spending time with her children or going out with friends. She feels exhausted, spends most days on the sofa, and has been missing work at the supermarket due to low energy and motivation. She reports financial stressors and relationship difficulties with her partner, Dave, who has become more distant. Alison describes poor sleep initiation (taking hours to fall asleep), frequent early morning awakening (around 4 am), and inability to return to sleep, resulting in persistent fatigue. Appetite has decreased, and she has lost weight. She reports poor concentration and memory, forgetting tasks related to her children and work, and difficulty following television programs. Alison feels she is not caring for herself or her children as she would like, expressing guilt and worthlessness. She denies current suicidal ideation or plans but has a history of a paracetamol overdose four years ago during a previous depressive episode, which she describes as impulsive and not premeditated. She has supportive relationships with her sister and some friends, and states she feels able to keep herself safe at present.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Appearance: Disheveled, low affect, poor self-care as per self-report.\n- Speech: Slow, monotone, coherent.\n- Mood: Subjectively low, congruent affect.\n- Thought process: Logical, though preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness and guilt.\n- No evidence of psychosis or current suicidal intent.\n- Insight: Good; recognizes symptoms and is seeking help.\n- Social: Two children (ages 9 and 11), lives with them, has a partner (relationship strained), supportive sister.\n- Function: Marked impairment in occupational, social, and parental roles.\n- No reported substance misuse (apart from occasional alcohol in the past).\n- No acute medical issues reported.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAlison is experiencing a moderate to severe depressive episode, characterized by persistent low mood, anhedonia, sleep and appetite disturbance, low energy, poor concentration, feelings of worthlessness, and significant functional impairment. There is a past history of a suicide attempt (paracetamol overdose) during a previous episode of depression, but no current suicidal ideation or intent. She has some protective factors, including her children, sister, and willingness to seek help. There are significant psychosocial stressors, including financial difficulties and relationship strain. No evidence of psychosis or mania.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Pharmacological:** Initiate Sertraline 50 mg once daily in the morning. Discussed potential side effects (e.g., GI upset, sleep disturbance, increased anxiety initially) and the need for several weeks before full effect.\n2. **Psychosocial:** Encouraged Alison to maintain contact with her sister and supportive friends. Advised on the importance of routine and self-care, even in small steps.\n3. **Safety:** Alison denies current suicidal ideation or intent and has a safety plan in place (will contact clinic or sister if thoughts worsen). Provided crisis contact information.\n4. **Follow-up:** Review in 2 weeks to assess response to medication, side effects, and risk. Sooner review if symptoms worsen or suicidal thoughts emerge.\n5. **Further support:** Discussed referral to counseling or psychological therapies (e.g., CBT) and provided information on local services.\n6. **Work:** Advised to consider discussing her situation with her employer and to seek support if needed.\n7. **Education:** Provided psychoeducation about depression, its symptoms, and the expected course of treatment.\n\nAlison was receptive to the plan and agreed to start medication and attend follow-up. She understands the importance of seeking help if her safety becomes a concern.",

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nAlison returns for follow-up, reporting ongoing fatigue and low mood. She describes persistent sleep difficulties, with nights of minimal rest and frequent awakenings, despite attempts to increase physical activity. She continues to experience poor appetite, often skipping meals, and has noticed some unintentional weight loss (clothes fitting looser, family members commenting). Alison expresses feelings of guilt regarding her limited engagement with her children, who have become more self-sufficient. She reports a distant relationship with her partner, Dave, and finds it difficult to communicate her feelings, fearing she may be a burden. Alison acknowledges some support from her sister, which provides brief moments of relief, but overall she feels isolated and has withdrawn from friends. Work remains a significant stressor due to unstable hours and lack of support, contributing to her anxiety. She denies any current thoughts of self-harm or suicidality, stating she has made promises to her family and feels able to keep herself safe. Alison identifies small positive moments with her children and sister but finds it hard to sustain hope. She notes increased screen time, which serves as a distraction but sometimes worsens her mood. She is open to trying strategies such as journaling, reaching out to friends, and increasing outdoor activity.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Appearance: Tired, low energy, affect congruent with mood.\n- Speech: Normal rate and tone, coherent.\n- Thought process: Logical, no evidence of psychosis.\n- Mood: Depressed, anhedonic.\n- Sleep: Ongoing insomnia, variable sleep duration, frequent awakenings.\n- Appetite: Poor, decreased intake, unintentional weight loss.\n- Medication adherence: Taking Sertraline daily as prescribed, no missed doses, no reported side effects.\n- Social: Limited support network (sister supportive, children self-sufficient), minimal contact with friends, strained relationship with partner.\n- Safety: Denies suicidal ideation or self-harm; safety plan in place.\n- Function: Struggling with work attendance and performance due to anxiety and fatigue; minimal engagement in pleasurable activities.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAlison continues to experience symptoms of moderate to severe major depressive disorder, with persistent low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, poor appetite, and social withdrawal. She is adherent to Sertraline with no side effects but has not noted significant improvement in core symptoms. Psychosocial stressors remain prominent, including work instability, limited social support, and strained family relationships. Protective factors include her commitment to her children and sister, willingness to engage in therapy, and openness to behavioral interventions. No acute safety concerns at present.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Medication:** Continue Sertraline as previously prescribed. Monitor for efficacy and side effects. Consider dose adjustment or augmentation if no improvement at next review.\n2. **Therapeutic Interventions:**  \n   - Encourage daily journaling to process emotions and track positive moments.\n   - Support Alison in initiating brief, honest conversations with her partner about her struggles, possibly starting with written communication.\n   - Reinforce the value of small, achievable goals: walking outside at least once this week, messaging a friend, and writing down one positive moment each day.\n   - Discuss strategies to limit screen time, especially before bed, to improve sleep hygiene.\n3. **Social Support:**  \n   - Encourage continued contact with her sister and gradual reconnection with friends (e.g., sending a text).\n   - Explore additional community or peer support resources if isolation persists.\n4. **Work/Function:**  \n   - Validate work-related stress; discuss coping strategies for managing anxiety at work (e.g., brief breaks, breathing exercises).\n   - Monitor impact of work instability on mood and functioning.\n5. **Safety:**  \n   - Reassess risk at each visit; Alison is aware of how to access crisis support if needed.\n   - Maintain open communication regarding any changes in mood or safety.\n6. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Review progress on behavioral goals and symptom changes at next appointment (scheduled in one week).\n   - Consider referral for additional psychological support (CBT or counseling) if symptoms persist or worsen.\n\nAlison is receptive to the plan and agrees to try the outlined strategies. She will contact the clinic if her mood deteriorates or if she experiences any safety concerns before the next scheduled visit.",

          "clinician": "That\u2019s good feedback. Sometimes the benefit is subtle, just getting a little distance from the cycle of thoughts at home. What about messaging a friend or writing in your diary\u2014were you able to try those?",
          "patient": "I messaged my old workmate, like you suggested. She replied\u2014it was just small talk but nice. I did write in the diary once or twice, mostly late at night when I couldn\u2019t sleep."

          "patient": "A bit lighter, I think. Less crowded in my head. Messaging\u2026 made me a bit anxious, like maybe she could tell I\u2019m not really okay. But it was good to just talk about something else, even just about her cat."

          "patient": "Sleep is about the same. Some nights I\u2019m scrolling on my phone too long, even though I tried to cut it back. I think I slept through two nights but then the next it was all over the place again."

        },

          "clinician": "Sounds promising. Sometimes these little habits build up to bigger changes. What about eating\u2014are you still struggling with your appetite?",
          "patient": "Yeah, pretty much. Still skipping meals, just don\u2019t feel hungry. The kids cooked scrambled eggs last night and I had a few bites, but mostly still just picking at things."
        },

          "clinician": "Thank you for sharing that. Low appetite is common with depression. How have your energy levels been\u2014any improvement, or still quite low?",

          "patient": "Not really. I thought about what we talked about last time, but I sort of chickened out. He\u2019s been quiet too. Sent a few texts but doesn\u2019t come by much lately."

          "patient": "Okay. Um\u2026 'Sorry I\u2019ve been distant. It\u2019s nothing you\u2019ve done, I just feel really low and it\u2019s hard to talk about it. I don\u2019t want to make you worry or feel like I\u2019m pushing you away.'"

      "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nAlison returns for follow-up, reporting that her mood has remained largely unchanged since the last session, with days often blending together. She describes ongoing low energy, persistent fatigue, and continued difficulty with motivation. Alison has made efforts to implement some behavioral strategies discussed previously: she wrote down one positive thing most days, walked outside twice, messaged an old workmate, and wrote in her diary on a couple of occasions. She notes that these activities provided brief moments of relief or normalcy, though the overall impact was subtle. Messaging a friend made her feel both lighter and somewhat anxious. Sleep remains inconsistent; she sometimes scrolls on her phone late at night despite attempts to reduce screen time, but found that reading a magazine instead helped her mind wander less. Appetite is still poor, with frequent skipped meals and only occasional small portions eaten, often when prompted by her children. Alison continues to feel guilty about her perceived lack of engagement with her children and work, having missed a shift due to low motivation. She describes her relationship with her partner, Dave, as distant, and feels both lonely and somewhat relieved by his absence. She has not had thoughts of self-harm or active hopelessness, though she does feel overwhelmed at times. Alison identifies her sister as a key support, with regular visits and phone calls providing some comfort. She expresses ongoing worries about finances and the possibility that her current state may not improve.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Affect: Flat to mildly reactive; able to express some positive emotions when discussing children and sister.\n- Speech: Normal rate and tone, coherent.\n- Thought process: Logical, though content reflects low mood and self-criticism.\n- Sleep: Fragmented, with some improvement when reducing screen time.\n- Appetite: Decreased, with minimal intake.\n- Energy: Low, with occasional brief bursts of activity.\n- Social: Maintains some contact with family and friends; limited engagement at work.\n- No evidence of psychosis, mania, or active suicidal ideation.\n- No medication currently prescribed.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAlison continues to experience symptoms consistent with moderate major depressive disorder, including persistent low mood, anhedonia, low energy, poor sleep, reduced appetite, and feelings of guilt and worthlessness. She is making incremental progress with behavioral activation strategies, such as journaling, walking, and reaching out to others, though the benefits are subtle and not yet sustained. Protective factors include strong support from her sister and children, willingness to engage in therapy, and absence of suicidal ideation. Stressors include financial insecurity, reduced work hours, and relationship difficulties with her partner. No current pharmacological intervention.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Continue weekly psychotherapy sessions focused on behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and social support.\n- Encourage Alison to maintain daily journaling of positive experiences, aim for at least one walk per week, and use music or podcasts in the evening as a relaxation strategy.\n- Support gradual communication with her partner, starting with written messages if face-to-face feels overwhelming.\n- Reinforce the importance of reaching out to her sister or clinician if mood worsens or if thoughts of self-harm emerge.\n- Discuss practical supports for financial stress and community resources at the next session.\n- No medication indicated at this time; continue to monitor for any changes in mood, sleep, appetite, or safety concerns.\n- Next appointment scheduled for the same time next week. Alison is encouraged to reach out sooner if needed.",
