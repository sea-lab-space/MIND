She has no contraindications to vaccination and no current illnesses. Her social history reveals significant personal responsibility and some financial stress, but no acute psychosocial concerns at this time. She is otherwise healthy and up to date on other preventive care.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. Administer Tdap vaccine (CPT 90715) intramuscularly in the left deltoid.  \n2. Observe Gabriella for 15 minutes post-vaccination for any immediate adverse reactions.  \n3. Provided education on common vaccine side effects (e.g., localized soreness, mild fever) and when to seek medical attention (e.g., high fever, persistent pain, allergic reaction).  \n4.

Gabriella also reports mild fatigue, a low-grade fever (subjectively, no measured temperature at home), and some nasal congestion. She denies cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or ear pain. She has not noticed any white patches or swelling in her throat. She has had difficulty sleeping due to discomfort and has missed one shift at her part-time waitressing job. Gabriella denies recent travel, sick contacts, or exposure to known strep throat cases. She is not currently taking any medications and has no known drug allergies. She expresses concern about missing more work and school, given her financial and academic responsibilities.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Vital Signs:  \n  - Temp: 99.8\u00b0F (oral, in office)  \n  - BP: 110/68 mmHg  \n  - HR: 82 bpm  \n  - RR: 16/min  \n  - SpO2: 99% on room air  \n- General: Alert, cooperative, appears mildly uncomfortable  \n- HEENT:  \n  - Throat: Mild erythema of the posterior pharynx, no exudates, no tonsillar swelling or petechiae  \n  - Tonsils: 1+ bilaterally, non-tender  \n  - No cervical lymphadenopathy  \n  - Nasal mucosa mildly congested, no discharge  \n  - Ears: Tympanic membranes clear, no effusion  \n- Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally  \n- Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs  \n- Skin: No rash\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella presents with symptoms and exam findings consistent with acute pharyngitis, likely viral in etiology given the absence of tonsillar exudates, significant fever, or cervical lymphadenopathy. Her mild nasal congestion and lack of cough further support a viral cause. There is no evidence of streptococcal pharyngitis or other complications at this time. Her symptoms are impacting her ability to work and study, which is a significant concern given her financial and academic pressures.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. Supportive care for acute viral pharyngitis:\n   - Encourage increased oral fluids and rest.\n   - Recommend acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for throat pain and fever.\n   - Suggest warm saltwater gargles and throat lozenges for symptomatic relief.\n2. Education:\n   - Discussed the viral nature of most sore throats and the lack of indication for antibiotics at this time.\n   - Reviewed red flag symptoms (difficulty breathing, drooling, inability to swallow, high fever, rash) and advised to seek care if these develop.\n3. Work/school considerations:\n   - Provided a note excusing her from work and classes for the next 2 days, with reassessment if symptoms worsen or do not improve.\n   - Discussed strategies for managing academic responsibilities during illness, including communication with professors.\n4. Follow-up:\n   - Return to clinic if symptoms persist beyond 7 days, worsen, or if new symptoms develop.\n   - Encouraged to call clinic with any concerns or if unable to manage symptoms at home.\n5.

She experiences mild wheezing and chest tightness approximately 2-3 times per week, usually triggered by exposure to cold air or dust at her part-time waitressing job. She occasionally has nocturnal symptoms, waking up with mild shortness of breath about once every two weeks. She denies any recent ER visits or hospitalizations for asthma exacerbations. Gabriella uses her albuterol inhaler as needed, approximately 2-3 times per week, and reports adherence to her daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone 100 mcg BID). She denies any side effects from her medications.\n\nGabriella mentions increased stress related to her academic break and financial pressures, as she is working extra shifts to help support herself and her mother. She feels tired but attributes this to her work schedule and studying for future re-entry into medical school. She denies cough, fever, chills, chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. No recent upper respiratory infections. She does not smoke or use recreational drugs.

She has mild, intermittent symptoms consistent with her diagnosis, with no recent exacerbations or need for systemic steroids. Her peak flow is stable and near her personal best. She is adherent to her medications and demonstrates good understanding of her asthma action plan. Increased fatigue appears to be related to psychosocial stressors (academic break, financial strain, increased work hours) rather than asthma. No evidence of acute infection or other complications.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. Continue current asthma regimen: Fluticasone 100 mcg BID, albuterol inhaler as needed.\n2. Reinforce proper inhaler technique and adherence.\n3. Encourage use of peak flow meter to monitor symptoms, especially during increased exposure to triggers (cold air, dust).\n4. Discussed importance of avoiding known triggers at work and at home; provided handout on environmental control measures.\n5. Address psychosocial stress: Provided information on university counseling services and financial aid resources; encouraged self-care and stress management strategies.\n6.

The pattern and characteristics of her headaches remain consistent with her previous migraines, and there are no red flag symptoms (e.g., sudden onset, focal neurological deficits, fever, or neck stiffness) to suggest secondary causes.

Alison reports that she ingested approximately 20 tablets (500 mg each) of paracetamol about 3 hours prior to arrival, in an attempt to \"escape overwhelming stress.\" She describes feeling hopeless and overwhelmed by recent life events, including instability at her retail job, ongoing financial pressures, and the challenges of raising two children as a single mother. Alison states she has been experiencing persistent sadness, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping for several weeks. She denies any prior suicide attempts but admits to having passive thoughts of self-harm in the past. She reports limited support from family and difficulty accessing mental health care that feels culturally sensitive. Alison is currently in a long-term relationship, which she describes as supportive, but she feels isolated due to her busy schedule and lack of time for self-care. She denies current alcohol or illicit drug use. No known allergies.

She is at risk for acute liver injury, though currently only mild transaminitis is noted. Her overdose appears to be a response to chronic stress, depression, and lack of adequate social and mental health support. She is currently medically stable and expresses remorse, with no ongoing suicidal ideation. Social determinants, including financial strain, single parenthood, and cultural barriers to mental health care, are significant contributors to her current crisis.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Medical Management:**  \n   - Initiate N-acetylcysteine (NAC) protocol for acetaminophen toxicity.  \n   - Monitor LFTs, renal function, and coagulation profile every 8 hours for 24-48 hours.  \n   - Supportive care: IV fluids, antiemetics as needed, monitor for signs of hepatic failure.\n\n2. **Psychiatric Care:**  \n   - Continue 1:1 observation for safety while inpatient.  \n   - Arrange for psychiatric consultation and crisis intervention.  \n   - Begin brief supportive counseling; explore coping strategies and safety planning.\n\n3. **Social Support:**  \n   - Consult social work to assess for resources, including financial assistance, childcare support, and culturally sensitive mental health services.  \n   - Provide information on local community mental health centers and support groups for Black women and single mothers.\n\n4. **Discharge Planning:**  \n   - Discharge only after psychiatric clearance and once medically stable.  \n   - Arrange close outpatient follow-up with primary care and mental health providers.  \n   - Encourage involvement of her partner and trusted friends/family in her support network.\n\n5. **Education:**  \n   - Educate Alison on the risks of acetaminophen overdose and the importance of medication safety.  \n   - Discuss warning signs of depression and when to seek help.\n\n6. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Schedule follow-up appointments within 1 week of discharge for both medical and psychiatric care.  \n   - Provide crisis hotline and emergency contact information.\n\nAlison was receptive to the plan and expressed willingness to engage in ongoing care."
