        "clinician": "Hi Gabriella, I understand that you're here today because you've been experiencing some low mood.",
        "patient": "Yeah, I just recently I've just... I'm just feeling down a lot and I can't really, like, snap out of it. Like, sometimes if it's happened before, I can just, like, get myself back on track. But recently I'm just finding it really difficult to do."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you've been experiencing some low mood and you're kind of struggling to get going a bit.",
        "patient": "Yeah, definitely."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "You've had low mood in the past, but it's kind of... you've been able to pull yourself out of it before, but more recently you've found that harder. Okay, so I understand that you first went to your GP, who referred you here about two months ago. Can I ask what led you to go to the GP in the first place?",
        "patient": "My long-term boyfriend broke up with me and it was, it was such a shock, like I really wasn't expecting it. It just got me really down. I felt really lonely. And I didn't really want to see people. I just wanted to be in my own space. My mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and he's referred me to you."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay? So it sounds like you had that breakup and you weren't expecting it, so it kind of came out of the blue a bit and you've been on your own quite a lot. So you're not been seeing people as much. And it sounds like your mum noticed that there's been a bit of a change in you. Okay, and how have things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the GP?",
        "patient": "I just, nothing's really changed. Nothing's really improved. I just... I feel down, like everything's an effort and feel distant from things. And like I said, I can't snap out of it."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, and how did you feel about coming here today?",
        "patient": "I was kind of disappointed in myself because I feel like nobody else my age is doing this. I should have been able to snap out of it, like it's just another thing that I've not really... you know, things that's making me stand out for the wrong reasons."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so you feel like it's kind of odd or unusual to be coming to see a clinical psychologist. I suppose I just want to reassure you that it's absolutely normal to have feelings of depression and anxiety. It's really very common, and it certainly isn't odd or strange at all. So it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today. So what I guess led you to do that? Because it sounds like maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you've managed to come anyway.",
        "patient": "I'm just hoping that it's going to help. I think I didn't really want to admit it because, like, it's just another failure, but my mum was talking to me and she's not really happy with the way I'm behaving. I didn't really want to disappoint her again. And so I thought there's no harm in it. So I came."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like partly you're doing it then for your mum because you're a bit worried that she isn't pleased with you at the moment.",
        "patient": "Yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Well, I think it's great that you've come here. And definitely there's a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression, and particularly the type of therapy that we're gonna be doing, which is called cognitive behavior therapy. I'll tell you a bit more about that as we go on, but I'm just trying to find out a bit more about you today. So I saw from your notes that you're a medic student.",
        "patient": "Yeah? I'm not currently in uni at the moment, but yeah, last year I was a medical student."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so I guess why, what's the reason that you're not in uni this year?",
        "patient": "It was pretty tough first year, so they then suggested that I took a year out. This is the break."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so just thinking, so that would be about 6 months ago, was it that your year out started? And it sounds then maybe like your first year was also quite tough?",
        "patient": "Yeah, it was. I thought it's tough for everyone, but obviously we all take it in different ways, don't we."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "And you're planning on returning?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I'm going to have to really."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "But you don't sound too sure about that.",
        "patient": "No, though I think returning is probably... that's what's going to make everyone happy. And I think, you know, at least I'll be able to finally achieve something and get something right. So yeah, like next year I'm going to... I'll get through that. Yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so it doesn't sound like you want to go back.",
        "patient": "I do. I didn't enjoy it. I just... I just don't feel like me at the moment. And I just, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of pressure. But that's what comes with it. And, you know, it'll work out for the best if I go."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so I guess then there's quite a lot of thoughts and feelings about going back at the moment. I'm just wondering, in the meantime, what are you up to, what have you been doing?",
        "patient": "Well, I haven't really had much on the horizon. My mom, her friends own a restaurant and she suggested that I did a bit of waitressing there, just doing it for a bit of money and stuff because obviously I'm not in uni, so you know, I've done that."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, how many shifts have you done there?",
        "patient": "I've only done one so far. Yeah, I don't know whether it's something that I'd probably go back to."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, when was that shift?",
        "patient": "It was last week, actually."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, and how was it? I suppose I'm intrigued, can you tell me a bit more about that?",
        "patient": "It was, it was different, you know, because it was like... I did enjoy it because it's just a different aspect and I had to speak to people and try to get their orders and try to remember it and stuff. I wasn't very good, but I suppose it was handy to have some money, like get out of the house."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you quite enjoyed that. Then what makes you think you weren't very good?",
        "patient": "I just felt slow. And people, sometimes they didn't understand what I was saying, so I'd have to talk louder or quieter, slower. And I got a bit confused sometimes with the orders, and I just don't really think that I'm not really like a friendly... like people don't really think that I'm a friendly person, so they didn't really want to talk to me and stuff. I felt like I was inconveniencing them, by like asking them things and getting things wrong. Yeah, they said that apparently most people get like a few mistakes on their first shift, but then again, she's my mom's friend, so that's probably why she's saying it."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So the person who owns the restaurant is your mum's friend. Okay, so you're saying that you think you weren't very good, and that's because you were a bit slow and you got confused with some orders. But you said it's common for people to do that on that first shift. That's what she said to you, but...",
        "patient": "But it's probably just she's just trying to make me feel better. She probably felt sorry for me because I'm obviously not very good at it, like I'm not very good at anything recently. I think she just felt sorry for me."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so I've just been noting down some of those thoughts that you've been having. You kind of say that you feel like you're not very good, you're slow, you're confused with the orders, and you feel like you're inconveniencing her and she feels sorry for you. I suppose I'm wondering, I mean, what makes you think that she feels sorry for you?",
        "patient": "Like I said, she's my mum's friend, and she's obviously feeling sorry for my mum as well because she's got a daughter that's not like anyone else of her age. And she's just like all alone and she's not getting involved. So I think she just feels sorry for me and she doesn't want, like, to upset me. But yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "When you're having these kind of thoughts, because that's quite a lot of negative thoughts you're describing, how do you feel?",
        "patient": "Just feel empty, I don't... I'm just calling as it is. I'm just calling it as reality. I feel like I'm being honest with myself by just voicing it and not trying to get around hiding it because I know, like, I can see it in myself."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you feel like those thoughts are very true then? I mean, if you were going to write them... So I'm going to pick out some of those thoughts you describe. You said 'I'm not very good', and 'I'm inconveniencing them'. How much would you say you believe those on a scale out of 100, where 100 is like, I absolutely believe it and 0 is like, I don't believe it at all?",
        "patient": "I'm about 80, yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So you feel quite sure that you definitely believe those, okay? And you said that when you're thinking those thoughts, you start to feel quite empty.",
        "patient": "I just feel distant and like I said, I'm not really myself, I just... It's like I'm not really there, but when I am, I can't even do a good job."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "And are there any other emotions that you experience?",
        "patient": "I feel drained. I'd say I feel like I'm not in touch with anything, just... it's like everything's going on around me, but I'm just not there. I'm just, it's like I'm just watching."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so you feel empty, distant, you feel drained. And how, when you're feeling these emotions, how do you feel in your body? Kind of what sensations do you notice?",
        "patient": "I don't know how to describe it. I get like, I have a bit of like, like, you know, when you kind of get like butterflies when you're nervous and stuff, kind of get a bit of that."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "You feel some butterflies? Yeah, did you have butterflies that night when you were at the restaurant?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I was pretty nervous. Then when I got into it, they went away and like it distracted me for a bit. And so obviously I realized that I wasn't doing a very good job."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay? And you, when you have those emotions, how does it affect your energy levels? Do you feel more energetic, less energetic, or about the same when you feel down?",
        "patient": "Yeah, when you're having those emotions that you were describing... I just feel drained, like didn't even have like the energy to wake up in the morning sometimes, like I just felt pointless, like my body's heavy and I don't want to. Yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you feel very tired. You're struggling to wake up. You said it's pointless. And what do you do then when you feel like that? So I guess you just talked about when you wake up in the morning and you feel heavy, and I suppose you've been maybe having some of these thoughts and those emotions potentially the night before, what do you then do? How do you respond to that?",
        "patient": "I just have to get up I suppose. I don't really have a choice because my mum, I live with my mom. I know it's hard for her, so I don't want her to be too worried. So I just... I just try to carry on as normal. It takes longer and I don't want to, but I do, so I'll go on with my routine."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So you're a bit slower in getting up, but you are still getting up anyway. And what about your kind of, what do you think about when you're doing that?",
        "patient": "I'm just thinking that nobody else is like me my age, like nobody should be feeling like this. And I'm the only one that does."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you think a bit more about the problem and you kind of spend time thinking about...",
        "patient": "How I hate it and I don't want to feel like this, but I do, and nobody else I know does. So it makes me feel even more alone and like getting me even more down. And I just don't want to disappoint anyone. I didn't really want it."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so it sounds like you're trying to toughen up on yourself a little bit, tell yourself to work harder, to be different.",
        "patient": "Okay."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "And when you start telling yourself that kind of thing, how does that make you feel? Does that make you feel better afterwards or worse?",
        "patient": "Feels worse. Because I still can't snap out of it, like I'm aware it's happening, and I just, and I'm trying, but I just can't. And then, and then it's just another thing that I'm failing at, just another thing that I can't really get."

    "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nGabriella, a young adult and former medical student currently on a year out from university, presents with persistent low mood and difficulty functioning. She reports feeling \"down a lot\" and unable to \"snap out of it,\" which is a change from previous episodes of low mood where she was able to recover on her own. The onset of her current symptoms followed an unexpected breakup with her long-term boyfriend, which left her feeling shocked, lonely, and withdrawn. She describes a lack of motivation, feeling that \"everything's an effort,\" and a sense of distance from her surroundings. Gabriella expresses disappointment in herself for seeking help, feeling that her peers are not experiencing similar struggles and perceiving her situation as a personal failure. She reports that her mother encouraged her to seek help and that her mother's concern was a significant factor in her decision to attend the appointment. Gabriella also describes negative self-perceptions, particularly after a recent waitressing shift, feeling slow, confused, and as though she is an inconvenience to others. She rates her belief in these negative thoughts as 80 out of 100. Emotionally, she feels empty, drained, and distant, with physical sensations of \"butterflies\" when nervous. She reports low energy, difficulty waking up, and a sense of heaviness in her body. Despite these symptoms, she continues to get up and follow her routine, largely to avoid worrying her mother. Gabriella ruminates on her perceived differences from her peers and fears disappointing others, which exacerbates her low mood.\n\n**Objective:**  \nGabriella appears withdrawn and expresses significant negative self-evaluation throughout the session. She is able to articulate her thoughts and feelings clearly, though her affect is flat and she appears emotionally blunted. She reports ongoing functional impairment, including social withdrawal, low motivation, and reduced energy. There is no evidence of psychosis, mania, or acute risk to self or others at this time. She denies any current engagement in university studies and has minimal engagement in work or social activities, having only completed one waitressing shift in the past week. No medication is currently prescribed.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella is experiencing symptoms consistent with moderate to severe depression, likely precipitated by a significant psychosocial stressor (breakup with her boyfriend) and compounded by academic stress and social withdrawal. She demonstrates pervasive negative automatic thoughts, low self-esteem, anhedonia, low energy, and psychomotor slowing. There is evidence of cognitive distortions, including overgeneralization and personalization, particularly regarding her perceived failures and social interactions. She is currently not taking any psychotropic medication. There is no indication of suicidal ideation or intent at this time, but her sense of hopelessness and self-criticism warrant close monitoring.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Initiate cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to address negative thought patterns, increase behavioral activation, and improve coping strategies.\n- Encourage gradual re-engagement in social and pleasurable activities, starting with manageable goals (e.g., additional waitressing shifts, reconnecting with friends).\n- Provide psychoeducation regarding depression, normalizing her experience and reducing self-stigma.\n- Involve Gabriella\u2019s mother as appropriate, given her supportive role, while fostering Gabriella\u2019s autonomy.\n- Monitor mood symptoms and functional status closely; assess for any emergence of suicidal ideation or significant risk at each session.\n- No medication is indicated at this time; reassess need for pharmacotherapy if symptoms do not improve with therapy alone.\n- Schedule follow-up appointment in one week to begin CBT and review progress."

Last time, you shared quite a bit about how you've been feeling since your breakup and the difficulties you're experiencing with motivation and self-esteem. How have things been for you since we last talked?",
        "patient": "Hi, um, thanks. I guess... things are kind of the same, honestly. Like, I still feel pretty stuck most days. I\u2019ve been trying to get out of the house more, like doing that waitressing thing last week, but it didn\u2019t really make me feel better, you know? Just more nervous and kind of overwhelmed.

When you think about the waitressing shift, what do you notice about your thoughts and feelings during or after that experience?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I guess that\u2019s pretty accurate. Um, during the shift, I was really nervous\u2014like, my stomach was doing flips, and I kept thinking I was messing up. I kept telling myself I wasn\u2019t good enough or that I was slow, and I felt kinda embarrassed when I didn\u2019t get things right. Afterward, I just felt... more down, like I failed again, even though everyone said it\u2019s normal for a first shift. I keep thinking maybe I shouldn\u2019t even bother trying if I\u2019m just gonna mess up anyway. It\u2019s like, I want to feel better, but I just end up feeling worse."

You mentioned feeling like you\u2019re just going in circles and that trying might be pointless because it leads to feeling worse. When you notice those thoughts, how much do you believe them on a scale from 0 to 100? For example, how strongly do you think \"I'm just going to mess up\" or \"I'm not good enough\"?",
        "patient": "Um, I\u2019d say... probably around 75 or 80. Like, I know part of me knows I might just be being hard on myself, but another part feels really convinced that I\u2019m just not cut out for these things, or that I\u2019m just going to keep messing up no matter what. It\u2019s kind of frustrating because I want to believe I can get better, but those thoughts feel so real sometimes.

You\u2019re caught between knowing they might not be entirely true and feeling overwhelmed by them anyway. When you think about trying to challenge these thoughts or tell yourself they might not be completely accurate, what kind of response do you usually have? Do you find it easy or hard to question or reframe those beliefs?",
        "patient": "Honestly, it\u2019s pretty hard. I mean, I try to tell myself, like, \u201cMaybe I just need more practice,\u201d or \u201cEveryone makes mistakes,\u201d but then I think, yeah, but what if I really am just not good enough? Or what if I\u2019m just fooling myself? It\u2019s like, I want to believe I can change, but my mind keeps pulling me back to those doubts.

When you\u2019re caught in that cycle of doubt and hope, what do you usually do? Do you find yourself ruminating, withdrawing, or perhaps trying to distract yourself?",
        "patient": "Um, I think I mostly just ruminate, honestly. Like, I keep replaying everything in my head\u2014what I said, what I did wrong, how I probably disappointed everyone, especially my mom. Sometimes I just want to distract myself, but I feel guilty about not doing anything productive or not trying hard enough to fix it. So, yeah, I guess I mostly just get stuck in my head, and that makes me feel even more tired and hopeless. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t really escape those thoughts, even if I want to."

Or what have you tried that maybe offers some relief, even temporarily?",

Sometimes I try to distract myself by watching shows or scrolling on my phone, but then I just feel guilty because I\u2019m not doing anything meaningful. Other times, I just sit there and think about everything, which makes it worse. I guess I haven\u2019t found a good way to stop those thoughts from taking over. It\u2019s like, I want to find something that can help me feel a little better, even if it\u2019s just for a moment, but I don\u2019t know what that is yet."

Or perhaps things you\u2019ve enjoyed before but haven't done recently?",

When I was younger, I\u2019d spend hours just sketching or writing stories, and it made me forget about everything for a bit. But now, I just feel like I don\u2019t have the energy or motivation to do those things anymore. It\u2019s like, even if I want to, I just can\u2019t seem to get started or find the interest.

    "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nGabriella returns for follow-up after her recent breakup, continuing to report persistent low mood, decreased motivation, and low self-esteem. She describes feeling \u201cstuck\u201d and notes that efforts to engage in new activities, such as a recent waitressing shift, have left her feeling more nervous and overwhelmed rather than improved. During the shift, she experienced significant anxiety, self-critical thoughts (\u201cI\u2019m not good enough,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just going to mess up\u201d), and embarrassment, which persisted afterward despite reassurance from others. Gabriella rates her belief in these negative thoughts as 75-80/100, acknowledging some awareness that she may be overly self-critical but finding it difficult to challenge these beliefs. She reports frequent rumination, particularly about disappointing her mother, and describes feeling exhausted and hopeless as a result. Attempts at distraction (e.g., watching shows, using her phone) provide little relief and often lead to guilt about not being productive. Gabriella identifies that she previously enjoyed drawing and journaling but currently lacks the motivation or energy to engage in these activities. She expresses willingness to try re-engaging with these hobbies in small, manageable steps and is open to practicing more balanced thinking to challenge her self-doubt. She remains frustrated by her persistent feelings of inadequacy but is interested in learning strategies to strengthen her self-belief.\n\n**Objective:**  \nGabriella is alert, oriented, and cooperative throughout the session. Her affect is subdued but congruent with her reported mood. Speech is coherent and goal-directed. She demonstrates good insight into her thought patterns and is able to articulate her struggles with negative self-talk and rumination. No evidence of psychosis, mania, or suicidal ideation is present. No medication is currently prescribed. Gabriella is not currently engaged in any structured behavioral activation or formal therapy outside of these sessions.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella continues to experience symptoms consistent with moderate depressive disorder, characterized by persistent low mood, anhedonia, low self-esteem, and significant cognitive distortions (e.g., negative self-appraisal, catastrophizing, and rumination). She demonstrates some motivation to improve and is able to reflect insightfully on her thought patterns, though she finds it difficult to challenge entrenched negative beliefs. Social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors are present, though she is making efforts to re-engage with activities. No acute safety concerns are identified at this time. Gabriella is not currently taking any psychotropic medications.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Continue supportive psychotherapy with a focus on cognitive-behavioral strategies, including identification and challenging of negative automatic thoughts.\n- Encourage Gabriella to re-engage with previously enjoyed activities (drawing, journaling) in a low-pressure, time-limited manner (e.g., a few minutes at a time) to promote behavioral activation and provide opportunities for positive reinforcement.\n- Assign homework to practice balanced thinking: when negative self-doubt arises, Gabriella will attempt to identify evidence for and against these thoughts and develop more compassionate, realistic self-appraisals.\n- Explore additional strategies for managing rumination and self-criticism in future sessions, including mindfulness or self-compassion exercises as appropriate.\n- Monitor mood, motivation, and engagement with activities at next session; assess for any changes in risk or emergence of new symptoms.\n- No medication indicated at this time; continue to evaluate for potential need based on symptom progression and Gabriella\u2019s preferences.\n- Schedule follow-up session in one week. Gabriella will report back on her experiences with drawing/journaling and practicing balanced thinking. \n\nGabriella is encouraged to reach out if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any thoughts of self-harm. She expresses understanding and willingness to try the agreed-upon strategies."

I kept telling myself I wasn\u2019t good enough or that I was slow, and I felt kind of embarrassed when I didn\u2019t get things right. Afterward, I just felt\u2026 more down, like I failed again, even though everyone said it\u2019s normal for a first shift. I keep thinking maybe I shouldn\u2019t even bother trying if I\u2019m just gonna mess up anyway. It\u2019s like, I want to feel better, but I just end up feeling worse."

When you notice those thoughts, how much do you believe them on a scale from 0 to 100? For example, how strongly do you think \"I'm just going to mess up\" or \"I'm not good enough\"?",
        "patient": "Um, I\u2019d say\u2026 probably around 75 or 80.

Or what if I\u2019m just fooling myself? It\u2019s like, I want to believe I can change, but my mind keeps pulling me back to those doubts.

Like, I keep replaying everything in my head\u2014what I said, what I did wrong, how I probably disappointed everyone, especially my mom. Sometimes I just want to distract myself, but I feel guilty about not doing anything productive or not trying hard enough to fix it.

        "clinician": "Exactly, Gabriella. You\u2019re already doing a great job of examining the evidence\u2014recognizing that you did some things right, and that others, like your mom, offered reassurance. The challenge is in balancing that evidence against the doubts that tell you otherwise. It\u2019s normal for those doubts to feel very strong, especially when you\u2019re feeling low.\n\nA helpful next step can be to create a more balanced thought\u2014something like, \u201cI may have been nervous and made some mistakes, but I also remembered some things and handled some situations okay.\u201d Does that resonate with you? Would you like to try crafting a balanced thought together?",
        "patient": "Yes, I think I could try that. It\u2019s kind of strange, because part of me still feels like I\u2019m just pretending or that I\u2019m fooling myself, but I guess I can see that I did some things right. Maybe I can tell myself that even if I was nervous, I still managed to do some things okay, and that\u2019s not nothing. I\u2019ll try to keep that in mind next time those doubts come up. Thanks for helping me see that there\u2019s a different way to look at it."

        "clinician": "That\u2019s a very thoughtful and balanced way to approach those doubts, Gabriella. Acknowledging both the difficulties and the successes can help you build a more realistic and compassionate view of yourself. Remember, challenging negative thoughts is a process, and it\u2019s normal for doubts to linger. With practice, it can become easier to see your efforts and progress more clearly.\n\nWould you like to set a small goal for yourself before our next session, maybe related to practicing this kind of balanced thinking or engaging in one of your favorite activities again?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I think I\u2019d like to try that. Maybe I can practice challenging my doubts when they come up, just like we talked about, and also try to do a little drawing or writing in my journal. Even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes, I think it might help me feel a bit more connected to myself. I\u2019ll see how it goes, and I\u2019ll let you know next time. Thanks for all the support today."

        "clinician": "That sounds like a very practical and compassionate plan, Gabriella. Practicing challenging your doubts when they arise and reconnecting with your creative outlets are excellent steps toward feeling more grounded and confident. Remember, progress can be gradual, and every small effort counts. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time.\n\nThank you for sharing honestly today. See you next time.",

    "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nGabriella returns for follow-up after her previous session, where she discussed ongoing difficulties with low mood, poor motivation, and self-esteem issues following a recent breakup. She reports that her mood and motivation remain largely unchanged, describing herself as feeling \u201cstuck\u201d and frustrated by a perceived lack of progress. Gabriella attempted to return to work as a waitress but found the experience overwhelming and anxiety-provoking, with persistent negative self-talk (\u201cI\u2019m not good enough,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just going to mess up\u201d). She rates her belief in these negative thoughts as 75-80/100, acknowledging some awareness that she may be overly self-critical but feeling largely convinced by these thoughts. Gabriella describes significant rumination, particularly about disappointing others (notably her mother), and reports that this mental loop is exhausting and contributes to feelings of hopelessness. She has tried distraction (e.g., watching shows, using her phone) but feels guilty for not being productive. She identifies a loss of interest and energy for previously enjoyable activities such as drawing and journaling, though she expresses some openness to re-engaging with these activities in a low-pressure way. Gabriella is interested in learning strategies to challenge her negative self-beliefs and is willing to try cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation, though she remains skeptical about their potential effectiveness.\n\n**Objective:**  \nGabriella is alert, oriented, and engaged throughout the session. Her affect is congruent with her reported mood\u2014she appears downcast, with low energy and some psychomotor slowing. Speech is soft but coherent and goal-directed. Thought content is notable for persistent negative self-evaluation and hopelessness, but there is no evidence of psychosis, mania, or active suicidal ideation. Insight and judgment are intact; she is able to reflect thoughtfully on her experiences and is open to therapeutic suggestions. No medication is currently prescribed. No acute safety concerns identified during the session.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella continues to experience symptoms consistent with moderate major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, low self-esteem, excessive rumination, and cognitive distortions (e.g., catastrophizing, all-or-nothing thinking). She demonstrates some motivation for change and insight into her difficulties but is struggling to break the cycle of negative thinking and avoidance. There is no current evidence of psychosis, mania, or acute risk to self or others. She is not currently taking any psychotropic medication. Her willingness to try behavioral activation (drawing, journaling) and cognitive restructuring is a positive prognostic indicator, though her skepticism and low self-efficacy may present ongoing challenges.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Continue weekly psychotherapy sessions with a focus on cognitive-behavioral strategies, including:\n  - Cognitive restructuring: Practice identifying, examining, and challenging negative automatic thoughts (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d) and developing more balanced, evidence-based self-appraisals.\n  - Behavioral activation: Encourage Gabriella to re-engage with previously enjoyable activities (drawing, journaling) in a low-pressure, time-limited manner (e.g., set a timer for a few minutes) to reduce rumination and increase positive reinforcement.\n- Set small, achievable goals for the upcoming week: Gabriella will attempt to draw or journal for a few minutes and practice challenging negative thoughts as they arise, noting any changes in mood or self-perception.\n- Monitor for any emergence of suicidal ideation or significant functional decline; provide crisis resources as needed.\n- No medication changes at this time; continue to assess for potential benefit of pharmacotherapy if symptoms persist or worsen.\n- Reassess progress and barriers at next session; explore additional cognitive and behavioral strategies as appropriate.\n- Encourage Gabriella to share her experiences with these interventions at the next appointment to collaboratively evaluate their impact and adjust the treatment plan as needed."
