        "patient": "Yeah, I just recently I've just... I'm just feeling down a lot and I can't really, like, snap out of it. Like, sometimes if it's happened before, I can just, like, get myself back on track. But recently I'm just finding it really difficult to do."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you've been experiencing some low mood and you're kind of struggling to get going a bit.",
        "patient": "Yeah, definitely."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "You've had low mood in the past, but it's kind of... you've been able to pull yourself out of it before, but more recently you've found that harder. Okay, so I understand that you first went to your GP, who referred you here about two months ago. Can I ask what led you to go to the GP in the first place?",
        "patient": "My long-term boyfriend broke up with me and it was, it was such a shock, like I really wasn't expecting it. It just got me really down. I felt really lonely. And I didn't really want to see people. I just wanted to be in my own space. My mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and he's referred me to you."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay? So it sounds like you had that breakup and you weren't expecting it, so it kind of came out of the blue a bit and you've been on your own quite a lot. So you're not been seeing people as much. And it sounds like your mum noticed that there's been a bit of a change in you. Okay, and how have things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the GP?",
        "patient": "I just, nothing's really changed. Nothing's really improved. I just... I feel down, like everything's an effort and feel distant from things. And like I said, I can't snap out of it."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, and how did you feel about coming here today?",
        "patient": "I was kind of disappointed in myself because I feel like nobody else my age is doing this. I should have been able to snap out of it, like it's just another thing that I've not really... you know, things that's making me stand out for the wrong reasons."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so you feel like it's kind of odd or unusual to be coming to see a clinical psychologist. I suppose I just want to reassure you that it's absolutely normal to have feelings of depression and anxiety. It's really very common, and it certainly isn't odd or strange at all. So it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today. So what I guess led you to do that? Because it sounds like maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you've managed to come anyway.",
        "patient": "I'm just hoping that it's going to help. I think I didn't really want to admit it because, like, it's just another failure, but my mum was talking to me and she's not really happy with the way I'm behaving. I didn't really want to disappoint her again. And so I thought there's no harm in it. So I came."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like partly you're doing it then for your mum because you're a bit worried that she isn't pleased with you at the moment.",
        "patient": "Yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Well, I think it's great that you've come here. And definitely there's a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression, and particularly the type of therapy that we're gonna be doing, which is called cognitive behavior therapy. I'll tell you a bit more about that as we go on, but I'm just trying to find out a bit more about you today. So I saw from your notes that you're a medic student.",
        "patient": "Yeah? I'm not currently in uni at the moment, but yeah, last year I was a medical student."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so I guess why, what's the reason that you're not in uni this year?",
        "patient": "It was pretty tough first year, so they then suggested that I took a year out. This is the break."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so just thinking, so that would be about 6 months ago, was it that your year out started? And it sounds then maybe like your first year was also quite tough?",
        "patient": "Yeah, it was. I thought it's tough for everyone, but obviously we all take it in different ways, don't we."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "And you're planning on returning?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I'm going to have to really."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "But you don't sound too sure about that.",
        "patient": "No, though I think returning is probably... that's what's going to make everyone happy. And I think, you know, at least I'll be able to finally achieve something and get something right. So yeah, like next year I'm going to... I'll get through that. Yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so it doesn't sound like you want to go back.",
        "patient": "I do. I didn't enjoy it. I just... I just don't feel like me at the moment. And I just, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of pressure. But that's what comes with it. And, you know, it'll work out for the best if I go."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so I guess then there's quite a lot of thoughts and feelings about going back at the moment. I'm just wondering, in the meantime, what are you up to, what have you been doing?",
        "patient": "Well, I haven't really had much on the horizon. My mom, her friends own a restaurant and she suggested that I did a bit of waitressing there, just doing it for a bit of money and stuff because obviously I'm not in uni, so you know, I've done that."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, how many shifts have you done there?",
        "patient": "I've only done one so far. Yeah, I don't know whether it's something that I'd probably go back to."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, when was that shift?",
        "patient": "It was last week, actually."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, and how was it? I suppose I'm intrigued, can you tell me a bit more about that?",
        "patient": "It was, it was different, you know, because it was like... I did enjoy it because it's just a different aspect and I had to speak to people and try to get their orders and try to remember it and stuff. I wasn't very good, but I suppose it was handy to have some money, like get out of the house."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you quite enjoyed that. Then what makes you think you weren't very good?",
        "patient": "I just felt slow. And people, sometimes they didn't understand what I was saying, so I'd have to talk louder or quieter, slower. And I got a bit confused sometimes with the orders, and I just don't really think that I'm not really like a friendly... like people don't really think that I'm a friendly person, so they didn't really want to talk to me and stuff. I felt like I was inconveniencing them, by like asking them things and getting things wrong. Yeah, they said that apparently most people get like a few mistakes on their first shift, but then again, she's my mom's friend, so that's probably why she's saying it."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So the person who owns the restaurant is your mum's friend. Okay, so you're saying that you think you weren't very good, and that's because you were a bit slow and you got confused with some orders. But you said it's common for people to do that on that first shift. That's what she said to you, but...",
        "patient": "But it's probably just she's just trying to make me feel better. She probably felt sorry for me because I'm obviously not very good at it, like I'm not very good at anything recently. I think she just felt sorry for me."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so I've just been noting down some of those thoughts that you've been having. You kind of say that you feel like you're not very good, you're slow, you're confused with the orders, and you feel like you're inconveniencing her and she feels sorry for you. I suppose I'm wondering, I mean, what makes you think that she feels sorry for you?",
        "patient": "Like I said, she's my mum's friend, and she's obviously feeling sorry for my mum as well because she's got a daughter that's not like anyone else of her age. And she's just like all alone and she's not getting involved. So I think she just feels sorry for me and she doesn't want, like, to upset me. But yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "When you're having these kind of thoughts, because that's quite a lot of negative thoughts you're describing, how do you feel?",
        "patient": "Just feel empty, I don't... I'm just calling as it is. I'm just calling it as reality. I feel like I'm being honest with myself by just voicing it and not trying to get around hiding it because I know, like, I can see it in myself."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you feel like those thoughts are very true then? I mean, if you were going to write them... So I'm going to pick out some of those thoughts you describe. You said 'I'm not very good', and 'I'm inconveniencing them'. How much would you say you believe those on a scale out of 100, where 100 is like, I absolutely believe it and 0 is like, I don't believe it at all?",
        "patient": "I'm about 80, yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So you feel quite sure that you definitely believe those, okay? And you said that when you're thinking those thoughts, you start to feel quite empty.",
        "patient": "I just feel distant and like I said, I'm not really myself, I just... It's like I'm not really there, but when I am, I can't even do a good job."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "And are there any other emotions that you experience?",
        "patient": "I feel drained. I'd say I feel like I'm not in touch with anything, just... it's like everything's going on around me, but I'm just not there. I'm just, it's like I'm just watching."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so you feel empty, distant, you feel drained. And how, when you're feeling these emotions, how do you feel in your body? Kind of what sensations do you notice?",
        "patient": "I don't know how to describe it. I get like, I have a bit of like, like, you know, when you kind of get like butterflies when you're nervous and stuff, kind of get a bit of that."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "You feel some butterflies? Yeah, did you have butterflies that night when you were at the restaurant?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I was pretty nervous. Then when I got into it, they went away and like it distracted me for a bit. And so obviously I realized that I wasn't doing a very good job."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay? And you, when you have those emotions, how does it affect your energy levels? Do you feel more energetic, less energetic, or about the same when you feel down?",
        "patient": "Yeah, when you're having those emotions that you were describing... I just feel drained, like didn't even have like the energy to wake up in the morning sometimes, like I just felt pointless, like my body's heavy and I don't want to. Yeah."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you feel very tired. You're struggling to wake up. You said it's pointless. And what do you do then when you feel like that? So I guess you just talked about when you wake up in the morning and you feel heavy, and I suppose you've been maybe having some of these thoughts and those emotions potentially the night before, what do you then do? How do you respond to that?",
        "patient": "I just have to get up I suppose. I don't really have a choice because my mum, I live with my mom. I know it's hard for her, so I don't want her to be too worried. So I just... I just try to carry on as normal. It takes longer and I don't want to, but I do, so I'll go on with my routine."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So you're a bit slower in getting up, but you are still getting up anyway. And what about your kind of, what do you think about when you're doing that?",
        "patient": "I'm just thinking that nobody else is like me my age, like nobody should be feeling like this. And I'm the only one that does."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "So it sounds like you think a bit more about the problem and you kind of spend time thinking about...",
        "patient": "How I hate it and I don't want to feel like this, but I do, and nobody else I know does. So it makes me feel even more alone and like getting me even more down. And I just don't want to disappoint anyone. I didn't really want it."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Okay, so it sounds like you're trying to toughen up on yourself a little bit, tell yourself to work harder, to be different.",
        "patient": "Okay."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "And when you start telling yourself that kind of thing, how does that make you feel? Does that make you feel better afterwards or worse?",
        "patient": "Feels worse. Because I still can't snap out of it, like I'm aware it's happening, and I just, and I'm trying, but I just can't. And then, and then it's just another thing that I'm failing at, just another thing that I can't really get."

    "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nGabriella, a young adult female and former medical student currently on a year out from university, presents with persistent low mood and difficulty functioning. She reports that her symptoms began following an unexpected breakup with her long-term boyfriend, which left her feeling shocked, lonely, and withdrawn. Gabriella describes a pervasive sense of sadness, lack of motivation, and inability to \"snap out of it,\" which is different from previous episodes of low mood that she was able to manage independently. She feels everything is an effort, experiences emotional distance, and reports feeling \"empty,\" \"drained,\" and \"not really herself.\" She also describes significant self-criticism, believing she is \"not very good at anything\" and is \"inconveniencing\" others, with a strong conviction in these negative thoughts (80/100). Gabriella expresses disappointment in herself for seeking help, feeling it is unusual for someone her age, and is partly motivated by a desire not to disappoint her mother. She reports low energy, difficulty waking up, and a sense of heaviness in her body. Social withdrawal is evident, with minimal engagement in activities outside the home, except for a recent waitressing shift, which she found anxiety-provoking but somewhat distracting. She continues to ruminate on her perceived failures and isolation, which exacerbates her low mood.\n\n**Objective:**  \nGabriella appears withdrawn and self-critical during the session. Affect is flat and mood is low throughout the interview. She demonstrates insight into her symptoms but is highly self-deprecating. No evidence of psychosis or mania. She denies any current suicidal ideation or intent, though her sense of hopelessness and worthlessness is notable. She is living with her mother, who is supportive and involved in her care. Gabriella is not currently attending university and has limited social or occupational engagement. She has recently started a job as a waitress but has only completed one shift, which she found challenging. No significant changes in appetite or weight were reported. Sleep appears disrupted, with difficulty waking and low energy. No substance use or medical comorbidities were discussed. She is currently prescribed sertraline 50 mg once daily, initiated by her GP.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella is experiencing a moderate to severe depressive episode, likely precipitated by a significant psychosocial stressor (relationship breakup) and compounded by academic stress and social withdrawal. Her symptoms include persistent low mood, anhedonia, low energy, negative self-appraisal, social isolation, and cognitive distortions (e.g., overgeneralization, personalization). She demonstrates some insight but is struggling to challenge her negative beliefs. There is no evidence of psychosis, mania, or acute risk to self at this time. She is currently on sertraline 50 mg daily, which may require further monitoring for efficacy and side effects. Gabriella is appropriate for psychological intervention, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as discussed.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Continue sertraline 50 mg once daily; monitor for side effects and therapeutic response.\n- Initiate a course of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to address negative thought patterns, behavioral activation, and coping strategies.\n- Encourage gradual re-engagement with social and occupational activities, as tolerated.\n- Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor mood, medication adherence, and safety.\n- Provide psychoeducation regarding depression, normalizing her experience and reducing self-stigma.\n- Involve family (mother) as appropriate for support.\n- Assess for suicidal ideation at each visit and provide crisis resources as needed.\n- Encourage Gabriella to keep a mood diary and note any changes in symptoms or side effects.\n- Reassess in 2-4 weeks to evaluate progress and adjust treatment plan as necessary."

Last time, we talked a lot about how you\u2019ve been feeling since your breakup and some of the thoughts and feelings you've been experiencing. I\u2019d like to start by checking in\u2014how have things been for you since our last session? Have there been any changes in your mood, thoughts, or daily routines?",
        "patient": "Hi, um, yeah, I guess\u2026 things have been a bit the same, honestly. I mean, I still feel kind of stuck, like I\u2019m just going through the motions most days. I did try to go back to the restaurant a couple of times, but I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s kind of overwhelming sometimes. And I\u2019ve been having a lot of those same negative thoughts about myself, like I\u2019m not good enough or I\u2019m just a burden. It\u2019s hard to shake them off, even when I tell myself I should try to be more positive."

You mentioned those negative thoughts\u2014like feeling not good enough or that you're a burden\u2014that are really persistent. When you notice these thoughts, how do they tend to influence what you do afterward? Do they affect your motivation or how you handle your day?",
        "patient": "Yeah, they definitely do. I mean, after I have those thoughts, I just kind of feel more drained, and it\u2019s like I lose any energy I had for trying to do anything. Sometimes I just want to hide or avoid things altogether, you know? Like, I\u2019ll think, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d and then I kind of just\u2026 sit with it, I guess. It\u2019s like these thoughts just kind of take over, and I forget that I even have the option to do something different. It\u2019s pretty exhausting, honestly."

        "clinician": "That\u2019s a very clear description of how these thoughts seem to sap your energy and make you want to withdraw. When you\u2019re feeling this drained and overwhelmed, what do you usually do? Do you have any specific strategies or routines you rely on, or do you find yourself just waiting for the feelings to pass?",
        "patient": "Honestly, I don\u2019t really have much of a strategy. Most of the time, I just try to get through the day, like I keep telling myself I just have to push on, even if I don\u2019t really want to. Sometimes I\u2019ll try to distract myself\u2014scrolling on my phone or watching something\u2014but it doesn\u2019t last long. It\u2019s like, I know I should do something, but I just feel so tired and disconnected that it\u2019s hard to even start.

When you think about that idea of \u201cwaiting for it to get better,\u201d what kind of thoughts come up? Do you notice any particular worries or hopes associated with that?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I guess\u2026 I worry that if I just wait, nothing will change, and I\u2019ll just keep feeling like this forever. Like, I hope that someday I\u2019ll wake up and feel okay again, but part of me feels like that\u2019s a long shot. Sometimes I think maybe I\u2019m just not meant to feel happy or motivated anymore, and that\u2019s kind of scary to admit. I don\u2019t really have any idea how I\u2019m supposed to get out of this, you know? It\u2019s like, I want to believe things can get better, but I also feel kind of hopeless about it."

That kind of ambivalence can be quite exhausting. When you have those feelings of hopelessness, what do they make you want to do or avoid? Do they influence how you approach your day or your thoughts about the future?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I think they do. Like, when I feel really hopeless, I tend to just want to avoid thinking about the future at all. It\u2019s easier to just focus on getting through today, or even just a few hours at a time. Sometimes I think about giving up on trying to feel better because it feels like, what\u2019s the point? But then, I also don\u2019t want to stay stuck forever, so I keep telling myself I should try, even if it\u2019s hard.

        "patient": "Honestly, I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve been thinking maybe I should try to get back to some kind of routine, like going for walks or doing small things that make me feel a bit more connected, but I don\u2019t know if I can actually do that. It just feels like I\u2019m too tired or too overwhelmed most of the time. Plus, I worry that even if I try, I\u2019ll just fail again or feel worse about myself. So, I guess I\u2019m kind of stuck between wanting to do something and feeling like I just can\u2019t."

Are there any specific worries you have about trying, or things that could help you feel a bit more supported in that process?",
        "patient": "I guess\u2026 maybe if I didn\u2019t have to do it alone. Like, if someone was with me or I had someone to remind me or encourage me, it might be easier. But I don\u2019t really have many people I can count on for that, especially not right now. And I worry that if I try to do it on my own, I\u2019ll just end up feeling more guilty or disappointed in myself if I can\u2019t keep it up.

When you imagine having someone with you, what kind of support or encouragement would feel most helpful for you? Would it be someone to just be there quietly, or someone to remind you gently, or maybe someone to do activities with?",

Sometimes, I feel like I get so caught up in my own head that I forget that I don\u2019t have to do everything alone. If someone could just kind of be there, without pressuring me to do anything, that might make me feel a little less like I\u2019m drowning. I guess I just want to feel less alone in all of this."

When you think about ways to incorporate that kind of support into your life, are there people around you\u2014family, friends, or others\u2014who might be able to offer that kind of presence, even if just occasionally? Or would you prefer to explore other ways to create that sense of support, perhaps through community groups or professional help?",
        "patient": "Honestly, I don\u2019t really have many people I can turn to like that. My mom\u2019s been busy with her own stuff, and I don\u2019t want to burden her more. I guess, in a way, I\u2019ve just been trying to handle everything myself, even though I know it\u2019s not really working. Maybe talking to you helps a little, but I wonder if I should try to reach out to someone else, like a friend or a support group, or maybe even a counselor.

When you think about reaching out to a friend, support group, or counselor, what do you imagine might make that first step feel more manageable? Are there specific concerns or fears you have about starting that process?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I think\u2026 I\u2019m worried that if I reach out, I might be judged or seen as weak or too much. Like, I don\u2019t want to bother anyone or make them feel like they have to fix me. And I guess I\u2019m also scared that I won\u2019t know what to say or how to start, like I\u2019ll just freeze up or back out before I even try.

For example, maybe writing down what you want to say, or choosing a specific person to talk to first?",
        "patient": "Hmm, maybe\u2026 I could try writing down some of my feelings or what I want to talk about. Like, just a few notes to myself, so I don\u2019t get too nervous or forget what I want to say. That might make it a bit easier when I actually do reach out, I guess. I\u2019m not sure if I could actually send a message or talk to someone face-to-face yet, but maybe just having those notes ready could help me feel a little more in control.

When you think about using those notes, do you imagine yourself practicing what to say, or just having them as a reference when you\u2019re ready to reach out?",
        "patient": "I think, maybe just having them as a reference. Like, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to read them out loud or say everything perfectly, but at least I\u2019d have something to look at when I start feeling nervous. It might help me to just glance at them and remind myself that I don\u2019t have to do it all in one go or say everything perfectly.

When you think about the next few days, what\u2019s one small action you might take\u2014like writing those notes or perhaps just thinking about who you might reach out to\u2014that could bring you a little closer to feeling ready?",
        "patient": "I suppose I could start by just writing a few sentences about how I\u2019ve been feeling, maybe tonight or tomorrow. Just to get it out of my head and onto paper, so I don\u2019t keep carrying it around all the time. I don\u2019t have to send it or talk to anyone yet, but at least I\u2019d have something to look at when I feel ready.

Like, right now, I don\u2019t think I could actually talk about all this out loud or even send a message, but I want to keep that option open. Maybe when I see it written down, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019ve started to get some of it out of my head, even if I can\u2019t do much about it yet.

As we continue, are there any other small strategies or thoughts that you think might help you feel a little more supported or in control as you work through this?",
        "patient": "I guess\u2026 maybe trying to be kind to myself, even just a little, could help. Like, not being so hard on myself when I feel like I\u2019m not doing enough or I mess up. I tend to be really critical inside my head, and I know that just makes everything worse. So, I suppose if I could find a way to be a bit more gentle, even if it\u2019s just for a moment, it might make things a little easier to handle.

When you think about being more gentle with yourself, what kind of words or phrases might you try to say to yourself, even just internally? Or are there specific moments when you could pause and remind yourself that it\u2019s okay to not be perfect or to mess up sometimes?",

Maybe I could even write down a few of those phrases and keep them somewhere I can see them when I start feeling down. It\u2019s just\u2026 hard to believe those words sometimes, but maybe if I hear them enough, it\u2019ll sink in a little."

Repeating them to yourself, especially when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or critical, can help counteract some of that negative self-talk. Keeping them somewhere visible is a good idea\u2014it can serve as a gentle reminder when you need it most. When you think about hearing or reading those words regularly, what would it take for you to start incorporating that into your daily routine? Would it be setting aside a moment each day to read them, or maybe adding them to your notes?",
        "patient": "I think\u2026 maybe I could try to read them every morning, like as soon as I wake up. Just a quick reminder before I start my day, so I don\u2019t go straight into all those negative thoughts. I could even write them on a sticky note or something, and put it somewhere I\u2019ll see it first thing. It\u2019s a small thing, but I guess it might help me start the day a little kinder to myself. It\u2019s not much, but maybe it\u2019s enough to make a tiny difference."

Do you think you might be able to set that up tonight or tomorrow morning?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I think I can do that. I mean, it\u2019s a small thing, but I guess I\u2019ve been looking for small ways to start feeling a bit better or at least less harsh on myself. I\u2019ll try to write those phrases tonight and put them somewhere I\u2019ll see them in the morning. It\u2019s not a big step, but maybe it\u2019s one I can actually stick to.

Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you want to share or discuss that might help you feel more prepared or supported for the days ahead?",

I don\u2019t want to give up completely, even if I feel like I want to sometimes. So, I guess I\u2019ll just keep trying those small steps and see where they take me."

Keep nurturing those small steps, and over time, they can add up to meaningful change. I appreciate your honesty and resilience today. We\u2019ll continue to build on these strengths in our next sessions. \n\nFor now, I\u2019ll make sure you have those phrases ready for tomorrow morning, and I look forward to hearing how that goes.

    "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nGabriella returns for follow-up after her recent breakup, reporting that her mood and daily functioning remain largely unchanged since the last session. She describes feeling \u201cstuck\u201d and \u201cjust going through the motions\u201d most days. Attempts to return to her workplace (a restaurant) have been overwhelming, and she continues to experience persistent negative thoughts about herself, including feelings of being \u201cnot good enough\u201d and \u201ca burden.\u201d These thoughts are described as exhausting and lead to decreased motivation, withdrawal, and avoidance behaviors. Gabriella notes that she lacks effective coping strategies, often relying on distraction (e.g., scrolling on her phone, watching TV), but these provide only temporary relief. She expresses a sense of hopelessness about the future, worrying that things may never improve, yet also holds onto a desire for change. Gabriella identifies a lack of social support, feeling isolated and hesitant to reach out to friends or family due to fears of being a burden or judged. She expresses interest in small, manageable steps toward improvement, such as writing down her feelings and using self-compassionate phrases, but acknowledges difficulty in initiating these actions. She is open to trying new strategies but remains ambivalent and anxious about reaching out for additional support.\n\n**Objective:**  \nGabriella presents as engaged and able to articulate her thoughts and feelings with insight. Affect is congruent with reported mood\u2014she appears subdued, with low energy and some psychomotor slowing. No evidence of psychosis, mania, or overt suicidal ideation during the session. She demonstrates good insight into her emotional state and the cyclical nature of her negative thoughts and behaviors. No medication is currently prescribed. Gabriella is not utilizing formal support systems outside of therapy at this time. She reports no significant changes in sleep, appetite, or physical health. No acute safety concerns identified during the session.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella continues to experience symptoms consistent with moderate major depressive disorder, characterized by persistent low mood, anhedonia, low energy, negative self-perception, social withdrawal, and feelings of hopelessness. She is currently in a cycle of avoidance and self-criticism, which perpetuates her sense of being \u201cstuck.\u201d Protective factors include her willingness to engage in therapy, insight into her struggles, and a desire to find small ways to improve her situation. Risk factors include social isolation, lack of external support, and ongoing negative cognitions. No current suicidal ideation or intent reported, but ongoing monitoring is warranted given her expressed hopelessness.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Encourage Gabriella to implement small, manageable self-care strategies, starting with writing down her feelings and self-compassionate phrases (e.g., \u201cIt\u2019s okay to not be okay,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s enough for today\u201d) and placing them somewhere visible to read each morning.\n- Reinforce the importance of self-kindness and patience, emphasizing that progress may be gradual and non-linear.\n- Explore options for increasing social support, including considering reaching out to friends, support groups, or additional counseling, while validating her fears and ambivalence about this process.\n- Continue to monitor mood, motivation, and safety at each session, with particular attention to any emergence of suicidal ideation.\n- No medication prescribed at this time; continue with psychotherapy as primary intervention.\n- Next session to review progress with self-compassion strategies and discuss any attempts or barriers to reaching out for support.\n- Provide Gabriella with resources for local support groups and crisis contacts, should she need additional support between sessions.\n\nGabriella verbalized understanding of the plan and expressed willingness to try the suggested strategies before the next session."

Last time, we talked quite a bit about how you've been feeling since your breakup and some of the thoughts and feelings you've been experiencing.

Sometimes I just want to hide or avoid everything altogether, you know? Like, I\u2019ll think, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d and then I kind of just\u2026 sit with it, I guess.

It\u2019s easier to just focus on getting through today, or even just a few hours at a time. Sometimes I think about giving up on trying to feel better because it feels like, what\u2019s the point?

        "clinician": "That\u2019s a very honest and meaningful insight, Gabriella. Simply having someone present\u2014without any pressure\u2014can indeed help you feel less alone and more supported. Feeling less isolated can be a powerful step toward easing some of that emotional weight and perhaps making it easier to take small steps forward. When you think about ways to incorporate that kind of support into your life, are there people around you\u2014family, friends, or others\u2014who might be able to offer that presence, even if just occasionally? Or would you prefer to explore other ways to create that sense of support, maybe through community groups or professional help?",
        "patient": "Honestly, I don\u2019t have many people I can turn to like that. My mom\u2019s been busy with her own stuff, and I don\u2019t want to burden her more. I guess, in a way, I\u2019ve just been trying to handle everything myself, even though I know it\u2019s not really working. Maybe talking to you helps a little, but I wonder if I should try to reach out to someone else, like a friend or a support group, or maybe even a counselor. I\u2019m just not sure how to start that or if it would even help."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "It\u2019s completely understandable to feel uncertain about reaching out, especially when you\u2019ve been handling things mostly on your own and worry about adding to others\u2019 burdens. The fact that talking here helps a bit shows that connection matters to you. When you think about reaching out to a friend, support group, or counselor, what might make that first step feel more manageable? Are there specific concerns or fears you have about starting that process?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I think\u2026 I\u2019m worried that if I reach out, I might be judged or seen as weak or too much. Like, I don\u2019t want to bother anyone or make them feel like they have to fix me. And I guess I\u2019m also scared that I won\u2019t know what to say or how to start, like I\u2019ll just freeze up or back out before I even try. It\u2019s kind of intimidating, even just thinking about it, but I also know I probably need to do something different. I just don\u2019t really know where to begin."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "Those fears are very common, Gabriella, especially when it comes to opening up about difficult feelings. The worry about being judged or seen as a burden can make the idea of reaching out feel even more daunting. When you imagine taking that first step\u2014say, talking to a counselor or a friend\u2014what small, manageable action could you consider that might help you feel a little more prepared or less overwhelmed? For example, maybe writing down what you want to say, or choosing a specific person to talk to first?",
        "patient": "Hmm, maybe\u2026 I could try writing down some of my feelings or what I want to talk about. Like, just a few notes to myself, so I don\u2019t get too nervous or forget what I want to say. That might make it a bit easier when I actually do reach out, I guess. I\u2019m not sure if I could actually send a message or talk to someone face-to-face yet, but maybe just having those notes ready could help me feel a little more in control. It\u2019s kind of a small step, but maybe that\u2019s what I need right now."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "That sounds like a very practical and gentle approach, Gabriella. Writing down your feelings or what you want to say can serve as a helpful tool to organize your thoughts and reduce some of the anxiety around initiating contact. Having those notes ready might give you a sense of control and make the process feel less overwhelming when you're ready to take that step. When you think about using those notes, do you imagine yourself practicing what to say, or just having them as a reference when you\u2019re ready to reach out?",
        "patient": "I think, maybe just having them as a reference. Like, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to read them out loud or say everything perfectly, but at least I\u2019d have something to look at when I start feeling nervous. It might help me to just glance at them and remind myself that I don\u2019t have to do it all in one go or say everything perfectly. I guess I\u2019m kind of scared of actually making that first move, but having those notes might make it a little less scary."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "That\u2019s a very thoughtful and realistic approach, Gabriella. Having those notes as a reference can serve as a safety net, helping you feel more grounded and less overwhelmed when you\u2019re ready to take that first step. It\u2019s completely normal to feel scared about making that initial move, but it\u2019s encouraging that you\u2019re considering small, manageable strategies to help you along the way. When you think about the next few days, what\u2019s one small action you might take\u2014like writing those notes or perhaps just thinking about who you might reach out to\u2014that could bring you a little closer to feeling ready?",
        "patient": "I suppose I could start by just writing a few sentences about how I\u2019ve been feeling, maybe tonight or tomorrow. Just to get it out of my head and onto paper, so I don\u2019t keep carrying it around all the time. I don\u2019t have to send it or talk to anyone yet, but at least I\u2019d have something to look at when I feel ready. It\u2019s a small thing, but I guess it\u2019s enough to help me feel a bit more prepared."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "That\u2019s a very sensible and gentle first step, Gabriella. Writing down your feelings can help you process what you\u2019re experiencing and create a little space between you and those overwhelming thoughts. It\u2019s also a way to acknowledge what you\u2019re going through without the pressure of immediate action. When you\u2019re ready to look at what you\u2019ve written later, what do you hope to gain from that? Or is it more about just having it there for when you feel more comfortable?",
        "patient": "I think, honestly, it\u2019s probably more about just having it there for when I feel a bit more ready. Like, right now, I don\u2019t think I could actually talk about all this out loud or even send a message, but I want to keep that option open. Maybe when I see it written down, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019ve started to get some of it out of my head, even if I can\u2019t do much about it yet. I guess I\u2019m just trying to find some small way to not feel so stuck all the time."

Giving yourself permission to take things at your own pace and keeping that option open for the future can be a helpful way to build confidence gradually. It sounds like you\u2019re really trying to find small ways to break that cycle of feeling stuck, and that\u2019s an important step. As we continue, are there any other small strategies or thoughts that you think might help you feel a little more supported or in control as you work through this?",
        "patient": "I guess\u2026 maybe trying to be kind to myself, even just a little, could help. Like, not being so hard on myself when I feel like I\u2019m not doing enough or I mess up. I tend to be really critical inside my head, and I know that just makes everything worse. So, I suppose if I could find a way to be a bit more gentle, even if it\u2019s just for a moment, it might make things a little easier to handle. But I don\u2019t really know how to start doing that, honestly."
      },
      {
        "clinician": "That\u2019s a very insightful observation, Gabriella. Recognizing the impact of self-criticism and wanting to treat yourself with more kindness is a meaningful step. When you think about being more gentle with yourself, what kind of words or phrases might you try to say to yourself, even just internally? Or are there specific moments when you could pause and remind yourself that it\u2019s okay to not be perfect or to mess up sometimes?",
        "patient": "Hmm, I suppose I could try telling myself, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to not be okay,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s enough for today.\u201d Those kinds of words, I guess, to remind myself that I don\u2019t have to be perfect or always get everything right. Maybe I could even write down a few of those phrases and keep them somewhere I can see them when I start feeling down. It\u2019s just\u2026 hard to believe those words sometimes, but maybe if I hear them enough, it\u2019ll sink in a little."

      {
        "clinician": "Those are very compassionate and supportive phrases, Gabriella. Repeating them to yourself, especially when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or critical, can help counteract some of that negative self-talk. Keeping them somewhere visible is a good idea\u2014it can serve as a gentle reminder when you need it most. When you think about hearing or reading those words regularly, what would it take for you to start incorporating that into your daily routine? Would it be setting aside a moment each day to read them, or maybe adding them to your notes?",
        "patient": "I think\u2026 maybe I could try to read them every morning, like as soon as I wake up. Just a quick reminder before I start my day, so I don\u2019t go straight into all those negative thoughts. I could even write them on a sticky note or something, and put it somewhere I\u2019ll see it first thing. It\u2019s a small thing, but I guess it might help me start the day a little kinder to myself. It\u2019s not much, but I wonder if it could make a tiny difference."

The idea of a sticky note is simple but effective\u2014something you can see right away and that doesn\u2019t require a lot of effort. How do you feel about trying this out over the next few days? Do you think you might be able to set that up tonight or tomorrow morning?",
        "patient": "Yeah, I think I can do that. I mean, it\u2019s a small thing, but I guess I\u2019ve been looking for small ways to start feeling a bit better or at least less harsh on myself. I\u2019ll try to write those phrases tonight and put them somewhere I\u2019ll see them in the morning. It\u2019s not a big step, but maybe it\u2019s one I can actually stick to. Thanks, I think that might help me get through some of the tougher days."

I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling ready to try this, and I hope it provides some comfort and support as you navigate these feelings. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you want to share or discuss that might help you feel more prepared or supported for the days ahead?",
        "patient": "Honestly, I think I just want to keep trying to be patient with myself. Like, I know I can\u2019t fix everything overnight, and some days will still be really tough. But I guess I just want to hold onto the hope that, little by little, things might get better, even if it\u2019s not right away. I don\u2019t want to give up completely, even if I feel like I want to sometimes. So, I guess I\u2019ll just keep trying those small steps and see where they take me."

Keep nurturing those small steps, and over time, they can add up to meaningful change. I appreciate your honesty and resilience today. We\u2019ll continue to build on these strengths in our next sessions. \n\nFor now, I\u2019ll make sure you have those phrases ready for tomorrow morning, and I look forward to hearing how that goes.

    "clinical_note": "**Subjective:**  \nGabriella returns for follow-up after a recent breakup, reporting that her mood and daily functioning remain largely unchanged since the last session. She describes persistent feelings of being \u201cstuck,\u201d low energy, and a sense of going through the motions without real engagement. Attempts to return to work have been overwhelming and draining, leading to increased fatigue and avoidance behaviors. Gabriella continues to experience pervasive negative thoughts about herself, including feelings of worthlessness and being a burden, which she finds difficult to challenge or escape. She reports a cycle of exhaustion, avoidance, and hopelessness, often feeling that improvement is unlikely. Gabriella notes that she lacks effective coping strategies and typically distracts herself briefly with her phone or TV, but these activities provide only temporary relief. She expresses ambivalence about the future, oscillating between hope for change and fear that things will never improve. Gabriella identifies a strong sense of isolation and a desire for support, but feels she has limited social resources and is hesitant to reach out due to fears of being a burden or judged. She is open to the idea of small, manageable steps, such as writing down her feelings or supportive phrases, and acknowledges the potential benefit of being kinder to herself, though she finds this challenging.\n\n**Objective:**  \nGabriella is alert, oriented, and engaged throughout the session. Her affect is subdued and congruent with her reported mood. Speech is coherent and goal-directed, though at times slowed. She demonstrates insight into her emotional state and the impact of negative self-talk. No evidence of psychosis, mania, or overt suicidal ideation is present during the session. Gabriella denies having a current support system and reports limited social interaction. She is able to identify and articulate her thoughts and feelings, and is receptive to therapeutic suggestions. No medication is currently prescribed. No acute safety concerns are identified at this time.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGabriella continues to experience symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including persistent low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, negative self-perception, hopelessness, and social withdrawal. She demonstrates significant cognitive distortions (e.g., self-criticism, catastrophizing) and avoidance behaviors that reinforce her sense of isolation and helplessness. Protective factors include her willingness to engage in therapy, insight into her struggles, and openness to trying small, incremental coping strategies. Risk factors include ongoing social isolation, low motivation, and ambivalence about the future, though she denies active suicidal ideation or intent. No current pharmacological interventions are in place.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Encourage Gabriella to continue with small, manageable steps toward self-compassion and emotional processing, such as writing down her feelings and supportive phrases (e.g., \u201cIt\u2019s okay to not be okay,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s enough for today\u201d).\n- Suggest placing supportive notes in visible locations (e.g., bedside, mirror) to reinforce positive self-talk, particularly in the morning.\n- Explore options for increasing social support, including considering reaching out to friends, support groups, or professional counselors, while acknowledging and validating her fears about being a burden or judged.\n- Reinforce the importance of patience and self-kindness, emphasizing that progress is gradual and non-linear.\n- Continue to monitor mood, motivation, and safety at each session; assess for any emergence of suicidal ideation or significant functional decline.\n- No medication prescribed at this time; continue with psychotherapy and reassess need for pharmacological intervention if symptoms persist or worsen.\n- Schedule follow-up session to review progress with self-compassion strategies and discuss any attempts to increase social support or routine activities. \n\nGabriella verbalized understanding of the plan and expressed willingness to try the suggested strategies. She will attempt to write supportive notes and place them where she can see them in the morning, and will consider writing down her feelings as a first step toward reaching out for support. She will continue to focus on being patient and gentle with herself as she navigates her recovery."
