    "description": "Mei Lin is a 20-year-old first-generation college student of Asian descent, currently studying biology at a large public university. She comes from a low-income background, working part-time on campus to support herself financially, which leaves her little time for rest or social activities. As the first in her family to attend college, Mei often feels immense pressure to succeed academically and make her parents proud. She struggles with persistent feelings of isolation, impostor syndrome, and guilt for not being able to support her family more. Recently, she has been experiencing low energy, difficulty concentrating, and trouble sleeping—symptoms that have gradually intensified over the past semester. Mei tends to internalize her struggles, fearing she might burden others or confirm cultural stigmas around mental health. Though high-achieving and thoughtful, she is quietly battling depression, uncertain of how to ask for help or where to start."

    "description": "Liam is a 21-year-old undergraduate student studying computer science at a large urban university. He immigrated to the U.S. with his family from Eastern Europe at the age of 13. While fluent in English, he often feels caught between two cultures, struggling to meet both his family's expectations and the demands of academic life. Financial stress is a constant—he works part-time in a campus IT help desk to support himself, but still relies on scholarships and student aid. Over the past year, Liam has experienced increasing symptoms of depression: persistent fatigue, difficulty concentrating on coursework, feelings of isolation, and a growing sense of hopelessness about his future. Although he is usually quiet and reserved, those close to him have noticed a withdrawal from social activities and a change in demeanor. Liam has not yet sought formal help, partly due to cultural stigma and partly because he worries about the cost and confidentiality of mental health services."
