She comes from a low-income background, working part-time on campus to support herself financially, which leaves her little time for rest or social activities. As the first in her family to attend college, Mei often feels immense pressure to succeed academically and make her parents proud. She struggles with persistent feelings of isolation, impostor syndrome, and guilt for not being able to support her family more. Recently, she has been experiencing low energy, difficulty concentrating, and trouble sleeping\u9225\u6515ymptoms that have gradually intensified over the past semester. Mei tends to internalize her struggles, fearing she might burden others or confirm cultural stigmas around mental health.
